S'Based on the Noise\'s rather pathetic Flames performance over the past couple weeks, he\'s donning Eli\'s jersey to "feel like a winner." Coming off a sour homecoming in New Orleans, the younger Manning is must-start material in Week 7. Arizona, which dismantled Seattle at Qwest Field last week, repeatedly disrupted Matt Hasselbeck with a barrage of blitzes. Due to the Hawks\' makeshift line, applying pressure was achieved. However, the Cards\' heat will be cooled against arguably the NFC\'s finest trench units, giving the Giants quarterback ample time to deliver passes downfield. Ken Whisenhunt\'s club has yielded 270.6 yards per game and nine scores to passers this season, equal to the fifth-most fantasy points allowed. Throw in \'Zona\'s stout run defense and the G-Men\'s difficulties in the ground department, particularly Brandon Jacobs\', and Eli could accumulate top-10 totals under the prime time lights.'

S'Over the first five weeks of the season, Carolina\'s rushing attack resembled a group of obese Garfields. But against a vulnerable Tampa front, DeAngelo Williams and Stewart were jum, both eclipsing the 100-yard mark for the first time this season. John Fox\'s powder keg should explode again this week. The banged-up Bills have conceded 205.7 total yards per game, 5.3 yards per carry and nine total touchdowns to rushers, equal to the most fantasy points surrendered. They also top the list in 20-yard run plays allowed (10). Due to Jake Delhomme\'s gross inadequacies and Steve Smith\'s nonexistence, defenses will continue to overload the box to stop the run. But as Stewie\'s tag-team partner told the AP earlier this week, the offensive line was "just moving guys" when presented with a similar obstacle against the Bucs. With the passing game underperforming, Fox will lean heavily on his ground game to turn the Bills into jerky. Expect Stewart to tally at least 12-15 touches.'

S"A fantasy Phoenix of sorts, Maroney rose from the ashes last week surpassing the 100-yard mark for the first time since 2007. Plowing through the snow, he exuded patience and ran with noticeable conviction, an effort that earned the admiration of Bill Belichick and scorned owners. The subject of much discussion in the virtual sports community this week, Maroney is a back many pundits and novices alike are uncertain what to make of. But with a friendly matchup against Tampa in the Land of Quarrelsome Gallaghers, Sir Laurence should live up to his knightly nickname. The sorrowful Bucs have yielded 4.8 yards per carry and 171.5 total yards per game to plowshares, equal to the fifth-most fantasy points surrendered. Based on Tom Brady's ability to stretch defenses thin, he should prove RB2 useful despite splitting touches with BenJarvus Green-Ellis and Kevin Faulk. Believe in the renaissance. Playing in London."

S"By now, many fantasy aficionados expected Brown to be the lead horse in the Colts' backfield. But, as team president Bill Polian said this week, the veteran will remain the primary option in the rotation over the foreseeable future in order to maximize the rookie's freshness for the long haul. Spectacular achievements haven't yet surfaced for Brown, but he's been flex serviceable against susceptible defenses. That scenario could unfold once again this week. The rancid Rams have shown significant improvement against the run this season, limiting backs to 3.9 yards per carry. But offenses continue to wear them down late in contests. Overall, St. Louis has allowed 149.7 total yards per game and nine scores, equal to the sixth-most fantasy points conceded. Because Peyton Manning will be able to operate uninhibitedly through the air, Brown could be worked extensively in garbage time. Don't be surprised if he breaks the 15-touch plane for the first time in his young career."

S"Fresh off the bye and two weeks removed from his record-setting performance in Kansas City, the Capital of Texas will levy burdensome taxes on the visiting Falcons. For the most part, Atlanta has performed admirably against the pass surrendering only one score and the ninth-fewest fantasy points to wideouts. But for the most part, the Dirty Birds have been a bend-don't-break secondary. They've conceded eighteen 20-yard pass plays, the seventh most in the league. With corner Brian Williams IR-bound (torn ACL) and given Austin's recent promotion, the third-year wideout, in an attempt to expose the Falcons' primary weakness, will be targeted often downfield by Tony Romo. If provided single coverage, a long touchdown or two could be in store."

S"Hamstrung over the first four weeks of the season, Sir Lance-a-Lot, finally 100 percent healthy, skewered the Giants in last week's Bourbon Street beatdown, snagging six passes for 78 yards and a score. Because amnesia is a prevalent problem in the fantasy community, Moore was largely dismissed by the impatient weeks ago. How soon people forget. Recall last season he was one of the game's finest waiver finds, totaling 79 receptions, 928 yards and 10 touchdowns. His 9.6 points per game output ranked No. 14 among receivers, one spot behind teammate Marques Colston. Obviously, Colston is Drew Brees' main flame, but in the Saints' seemingly unstoppable spread-the-wealth attack he should continue to net at least 6-9 targets per contest. Miami has performed marginally against the pass allowing the seventh-most 20-yard pass plays. Throw in the Fins' inflexibility up front, and Moore could be a vertical slayer on South Beach."

S"Featured as a Shocker Special two weeks ago, The Reporter hasn't quite delivered front-page news. Though he's averaged a respectable 49.3 yards per contest, he's splashed pay-dirt just one time in six games. The latter number could increase this week. The Purple People Eaters have manhandled opponents (sans Ray Rice) in the trenches, limiting rushers to just 3.8 yards per carry. However, vertically they've left a lot to be desired. Opponents have totaled the second-most explosive pass plays (20-yards plus) against the Vikes. Foot-sprained corner Antoine Winfield's likely absence only intensifies their situation. Suffice to say, Ben Roethlisberger will party like Jeff Reed. Look for the Steelers' speedster to take advantage of his opponent's downfield shortcomings."

S"Over the first few weeks of the season, Olsen was more She-Ra than He-Man. But with his role increasing in the Bears' offense and riding the crest of a three-game scoring streak, he should post his finest effort of the season this week in Cincinnati. Because the Bengals employ bracket coverage, numerous voids are presented in the short-field, a hindrance which was exploited endlessly by Matt Schaub. Last week, Steve Slaton and Owen Daniels were provided abundant space within five yards of the line. When the dust settled, the duo combined for 180 receiving yards and three scores. Expect Ron Turner to attack the Queen City Kitties similarly. Olsen should entice double-digit targets and surpass the 60-yard mark for the first time this season."

S'In his most recent gaffe, the absentminded McNabb not only forgot the number of remaining timeouts, but also who he was playing last week. After tallying only 269 yards without a touchdown against the rancid Raiders, McRib is a suspect play this week in Washington. Surprisingly, the \xe2\x80\x98Skins have not allowed a multi-TD passer this season, limiting gunslingers to a mere 182.5 yards per game and five scores, equal to the fourth-fewest fantasy points conceded. In his recent history against \xe2\x80\x98Skins, the veteran has struggled. Last season, he averaged just 213 yards per game with zero scores in two contests against them. Dragged to the turf six times by Oakland last week, McNabb will likely be badgered incessantly again this week. Unless the Eagles fix their "fundamental breakdowns," it could be another dose of disappointment for the dimming Philly star.'

S'For those who subscribe to the "Always start your studs" theory, listing the Purple Jesus as a lame is complete sacrilege. Their argument: his otherworldly abilities could lead to banner numbers regardless of opponent. Although their reasons are justified, Peterson isn\'t immune from poor performances. Remember Weeks 3 and 5 last year? Mike Tomlin admitted All Day is "the best football player in the world right now." Translation: he will be the focal point of mastermind Dick LeBeau\'s gameplan. An aggressive, run-blitz crazed scheme will surely be implemented, especially with Troy Polamalu healthy. Pittsburgh hasn\'t allowed a 100-yard rusher in 28 straight games. This year, they\'ve also held tugboats to just 3.3 yards per carry, 90.3 total yards per game and two scores, equal to the fewest fantasy points allowed. Demoting Peterson is unthinkable, but the odds are somewhat favorable he posts bland totals.'

S'For one week only, the Noise is calling off his long-running bromance with the PT Bruiser. Unsettling matchups can be a home-wrecker. Miami has swarmed rushers with the instinct of blood-thirsty sharks, not helmet-wearing porpoises. In five games, they\'ve conceded a mere 3.2 yards per carry, 106.8 total yards per game and four scores to RBs, equal to the seventh-fewest fantasy points allowed. Thomas is clearly more talented than Mike Bell, but the goal-line poacher\'s moderate success inside the five last week is very disconcerting. Similar to the Ray Rice-Willis McGahee situation earlier this year, PT will have to break runs to score six, a frightening prospect for those in TD-heavy formats. Despite the concern, there is hope he could regain touches near the chalk. Sean Payton remarked earlier this week the backfield formula "isn\'t exact." In a bye-heavy week, he\'s still a suitable flex and RB2 option in deeper formats, but for those in shallower leagues, Joseph Addai (at StL), Marshawn Lynch (at Car) and even Leon Washington (vs. Oak) are safer plays.'

Drafted on average around pick No. 12 overall, the freakish runner, openly frustrated by his performance, has appeared timid and unassertive. The results support this observation. Jacobs ranks 30th in points per game at his position, averaging just 3.6 yards per carry and 64.7 rushing yards per game. Shockingly, the Cardinals boast the league's top run defense limiting rushers to a horrid 2.7 yards per carry. They've also yielded the fourth-fewest fantasy points to plowshares. Eventually, Jacobs will tally profitable results, but based on the unfriendly matchup and his recent mellow performances, he's pine worthy in Week 7."

S'Despite Carolina\'s consecutive wins, Smith has expressed "bittersweet" emotions over the teams\' recent surge and his lack of involvement in the passing game. He\'s even gone as far to say "I\'m no longer an asset to the team." Whining has always been one of Smith\'s finer talents. With a competent quarterback, the multi-time All-Pro would still be a fantasy baron, but because a Jake Delhomme pass couldn\'t pierce tissue paper, he will continue to wallow, especially this week against the Bills. As John Fox described with an excellent basketball analogy earlier this week, he would rather shoot layups (run) than rely on 3-pointers (pass). Due to Buffalo\'s gross inadequacies between the hashmarks, Williams and Stewart will be fully utilized. Overcoming a plethora of injuries - and because most teams have demoralized them via the ground - the Bills have performed terrifically against the pass, surrendering the fewest fantasy points to wideouts and the third-fewest 20-yard pass plays. Smith, who has caught just 45.7 percent of passes thrown his direction, is due for another major letdown.'

S'Boldin stated Wednesday he\'s a game-time decision with an ankle sprain, saying his availability for Sunday\'s pivotal clash against the Giants is "up in the air right now." Because he\'s a warrior \xe2\x80\x93 remember he refused to take pain killers for his shattered face last year \xe2\x80\x93 there\'s a very strong likelihood he will suit up Sunday. However, he shouldn\'t for your fantasy team. When Boldin played through a similar setback Week 1 versus San Francisco, he completely vanished, totaling just two catches for 19 yards. On paper, he may be slated for No. 2 action, but Steve Breaston will be Kurt Warner\'s true primary second option. As the Giants secondary proved last week, they\'re not nearly as good as the numbers may indicate. Recall they faced several UFL caliber quarterbacks (i.e. Jason Campbell, Josh Johnson/Byron Leftwich, Matt Cassel and JaMarcus Russell) before being dissected by Brees. Still, the incredibly tough veteran is unemployable even if he avoids the inactive list.'

S'Don Flamingo\'s brief revival on South Beach was exactly that \xe2\x80\x93 brief. Due to Mark Sanchez\' inefficiencies and, as Rex Ryan noted earlier this week, the increase of two-deep coverage schemes being used against the Jets, Edwards\' acquisition has been "good news-bad news." Offensive coordinators have creatively shifted around top targets to avoid the Black Death, Nnamdi Asomugha. As a result, No. 1s have performed 12.1 percent above the league average against Oakland according to Football Outsiders. However, only one receiver has reached the 80-yard mark against the Raiders this season. Given the struggles of the Silver and Black\'s run defense and Sanchez, Thomas Jones and Leon Washington will be the focus of the gameplan, stymieing scoring opportunities for Edwards. Austin Collie (at StL), Hakeem Nicks (vs. Ari) and Sidney Rice (at Pit) are better plays.'

S"Davis, timid and apprehensive in his route-running two weeks ago against Atlanta, hasn't quite conquered the demons of inconsistency. Expect another rollercoaster ride this week. Though deplorable up front, DeMeco Ryans and his cohorts have routinely stuffed tight ends this season. They've surrendered just one touchdown along with 3.2 receptions and 40.8 yards per game equal to the fifth-fewest fantasy points conceded. With Frank Gore back at full-strength and Michael Crabtree slated for action, opportunities for Davis will be few-and-far between, especially in Jimmy Raye's largely conservative system. Emerging talent Brian Cushing will have his hands full, but his superb speed and dexterity should be able to keep Davis at bay. You're still playing VD in most leagues, particularly PPR formats, but the end-zone could be elusive."

S'Garrard, along with Jurassic-aged Torry Holt, are patriarchs overseeing a group of prepubescent tweens - the NFL\'s version of "Two and a Half Men." This week, the veteran and his compatriot should bear many fruits in the Sunshine State showdown. For most of the season, the Fins have struggled to ground aerial attacks. Due to their strong interior play, offensive coordinators have focused more on moving the chains vertically. Though Miami played fairly well down the stretch against Tom Brady a week ago, it has still surrendered generous points to quarterbacks over the past several weeks. Since Week 9, the Fins have allowed 270.6 passing yards per game and six scores, equal to the eighth-most fantasy points yielded. Based on his lopsided splits, the Beer Truck is unquestionably a homebody. In six home games he\'s averaged 276.2 yards per game and tossed nine touchdowns. He\'s also chipped in 25.7 rushing yards per contest. Miami\'s youthful secondary is showing signs of maturation, particularly Vontae Davis, but this is still a vulnerable unit. Garrard is sharpening his canines...'

S"Brady may think he's playing alongside a tranquil band of pacifists, but Maroney is one Patriot with musket always loaded. The pugnacious attitude he's recently exhibited is clear proof. Although he's losing touches to Sammy Morris and has averaged just 62.7 total yards per game since Week 9, Maroney has routinely exercised his bloodhound nose. Over his past seven contests he's sniffed the chalk six times. Bill Belichick is a skyward thinker, but this week the Pats ground game will likely be leaned on heavily. Carolina has played exceptional pass defense for much of the season. The Panthers rank sixth in the league in that category. Conversely, they've been blasted in the trenches. Over the past five weeks, Jon Fox's club has surrendered 4.8 yards per carry, 163.4 total yards per game and six touchdowns to rushers, equal to the sixth-most fantasy points allowed. With New England's division lead on the ropes, Maroney tosses a few haymakers."

S"With Clinton Portis on injured reserve, everyone's favorite sideline Einstein, Jim Zorn, has installed the ever popular three-headed rodent backfield. This week, Ganther assumes the role of Master Splinter. In limited doses, the fourth-year rusher has shown the explosiveness Washington has lacked at running back for much of the season. Over the past two weeks, the former Tennessee bench warmer has averaged an impressive 6.0 yards per carry. This week against the suddenly not-so-rancid Raiders, he should be considered a strong deep-league flex play. Over the past five weeks Oakland has ceded 5.3 yards per carry, 172.3 total yards per game and three scores to rushers, equal to the ninth-most fantasy points allowed. Sherm Lewis appears committed to a balanced approach, but this week, the ground game could be the headline act. Rock Cartwrigtht and to a lesser extent Marcus Mason will wrest away touches, but the 42 percent-owned back should be snatched up if your alternatives are sketcky."

S"Hightower's fourth-quarter 32-yard scamper last week against the Vikings embodies who he is: a hardnosed, versatile threat who Beanie Wells owners can't stand. Several weeks ago, many in Fantasyland disagreed with the Noise's perspective the former fifth-round pick would withstand Wells' charge. Lately both backs have produced mediocre returns, but the incumbent is still the more complete back. This week, the well-rounded rusher could generate surprising numbers. The Niners have proven to be inflexible between the tackles at times, allowing just 3.8 yards per carry to rushers. But opponents have had substantial success attacking them in the flat. No defense has surrendered more receptions to runners than San Francisco. On the year, Mike Singletary's crew has yielded 7.2 catches and 54.1 yards per game to backs. Hightower torched them for a fluky 12 receptions and 121 yards Week 1, a total he'll surely fall well short of in the rematch. But in what will surely be a hotly contested game, the Cards' all-around threat should again be highly useful in PPR formats."

S"Garcon's barometric reading is low. Defenses have aggressively attacked Reggie Wayne, rotating coverage to his side, which has lowered pressure on Pierre. The result: he's snagged 17 passes for 307 yards over the past three weeks, the fourth-best yardage total in the league. The trend likely won't be bucked this week against the Broncos. Champ Bailey and Brian Dawkins have played spectacularly this season. The duo has yet to concede a 100-yard receiver and have allowed the fourth-fewest fantasy points to wideouts on the year. However, if safety help continues to shift over to Wayne's side, forcing Garcon into man coverage, Peyton Manning will surely take advantage. The former Mount Union standout, similar to Robert Meachem, is a generic name that deserves strong start consideration over underperforming stars."

S'The likely absence of Hines Ward, who Mike Tomlin described as having "not favorable" odds of playing, propels the rookie into the starting lineup. Wallace was a midseason wire gem totaling three scores while averaging 65.3 yards per game from Weeks 3-9. But since then, he\'s essentially disappeared, netting just five catches for 82 yards. However, due to his presumed increased role and the attention Santonio Holmes will attract, the youngster should reemerge from obscurity. The Browns have surrendered the fourth-most 20-yard pass plays this season. Wallace\'s blazing speed will have Cleveland defenders screaming for Excedrin. Look for him to connect with Ben Roethlisberger on a couple explosive pass plays.  (Update: For those Al Rokers in attendance who are fearful of the forecasted snow and winds tonight in Cleveland, relax. Per NOAA, winds are expected to range between 23-29 mph with scattered snow showers. That\'s hardly a blizzard. It\'s important not to overrate meteorological effects this time every year. Remember what Matt Cassel accomplished versus Arizona in a driving snowstorm a year ago? Roethlisberger, Mendenhall and Holmes are still safe plays.)'

S"For much of the season, the Miami offense has been a one-trick fish. Ronnie Brown and Ricky Williams have spearheaded a largely conservative offense. But with Brown down and out, the Fins have caged the Wildcat, turning to the air more often. As a positive consequence, Bess has blossomed. Fantasy's Tenderoni, who's caught 70.2 percent of passes thrown his direction, has become Chad Henne's weapon of choice. Over the past five weeks, he's enticed 9.2 targets per game, averaging 5.8 receptions and 68.4 yards. Touchdowns have been and will continue to be a luxury item - he has just two scores in 28 career games - but the smooth wideout is an unsung PPR hero with significant Week 14 upside. Minus Rashean Mathis, the Jags have been skinned vertically. Since Week 9, they've allowed the eighth-most fantasy points to receivers. Over that same stretch, No. 1 targets have averaged 97.6 yards per game and totaled five touchdowns. Because Jacksonville doesn't possess a viable pass rush, Henne should be able to deliver crisp slants and outs to Bess early and often, especially when the receiver garners man coverage. Given his excellent YAC abilities, he should again net terrific WR3 totals in deeper formats."

This week, one of Eli Manning\'s favorite red zone weapons, should again strum on the six-string. Consider him a top 10 play.'

In his past two games he's netted a stupid 13.1 yards per attempt. Focused and grounded, he's hopeful his raging play will flood Cowboys Stadium. But the \xe2\x80\x98Boys, including their cheerleaders, have plenty of floaties on hand. Terence Newman and Mike Jenkins have played brilliantly in coverage over the past several weeks. In their past five games, including clashes with pass-heavy Philly and Green Bay, the tandem has allowed just 222.6 passing yards per game and five touchdowns to passers, equal to the ninth-fewest fantasy points yielded. Rivers isn't a benchable commodity in 12-team leagues, but in extreme cases where owners have Brett Favre or Matt Schaub to lean on, he's pine worthy."

S"San Francisco's transition from a conservative, pound-you-into-submission offense to a shotgun spread system has marginalized Gore's value. Essentially, the versatile back has taken on a Hightower-esque role over the past three weeks, netting just 16 touches per game, many of which have come via the air (five rec/g). Gore has been unsurprisingly apathetic about the philosophical tide shift. With Alex Smith flourishing, don't expect Jimmy Raye to suddenly reverse field, especially this week. The Cardinals typically employ several dime and nickel packages on defense, which makes it difficult to apply pressure on the pocket. When Smith has had time, he's thrown several strikes to playmakers Vernon Davis and Michael Crabtree. If Arizona plays tight defense between the tackles, the Niners will likely abandon the run to take advantage of what the defense provides. Ultimately, Gore should produce favorably in PPR-heavy formats, but for standard leaguers, another damning effort is likely on tap."

S"Marty Morninweg is a deceptive code that simply can't be cracked. After featuring McCoy prominently in Weeks 11 and 12, last week the Eagles left the rookie with Mike Vick protesters outside the Georgia Dome. Despite building an insurmountable lead early, the misused back totaled just nine touches for 26 yards. Baffling. This week, his workload should increase, but the quality of opponent is slightly tougher. After a string of disastrous defensive performances, the Giants have rediscovered their mojo, particularly up front. Over the past five weeks, the G-Men have held backs to a mere 2.8 yards per carry and 90.8 total yards per game, equal to the sixth-fewest fantasy points allowed. Due to Morninweg's often schizophrenic gameplans and the difficult matchup, McCoy should be labeled untrustworthy in Round 1."

S"Every Sunday is Groundhog Day in Chicago. Bill Murray, one of the Windy City's greatest sports enthusiasts, would agree. The Bears are a sordid mess offensively. Jay Cutler has suddenly morphed into Rex Grossman and Forte has become a Salaam-Enis-Benson conglomerate. Lovie Smith's desire to evaluate Kahlil Bell combined with an unsavory matchup labels the first-round bust a must bench player in non-PPR leagues. As Ray Rice would attest, the Packers' 3-4 has played brilliantly against the run surrendering just 3.5 yards per carry and the third-fewest fantasy points to rushers on the season. The Bears' rickety offensive line doesn't stand a chance. Insert Forte into your lineup only in the flex in 12-team and deeper PPR formats."

S'Wayne, hounded relentlessly by defensive backs, has vanished over the past couple weeks. As Manning noted after last week\'s extinguishing of red-hot Tennessee, the multi-time All-Pro has suffered from numerous "coverages, double teams to his side." No. 18 will continue to feed him the ball, but he won\'t force the issue if his top target is blanketed. This week, Wayne could again be wrapped in a Snuggie. As discussed previously, no wideout has reached triple digits against Bailey and Dawkins this season. They\'ve also surrendered just seven scores to receivers this year, the fourth-lowest total in the league. Because of Wayne\'s scoring potential, he cannot be demoted, but another vanilla performance is certainly possible. Over the past two weeks, he\'s racked only seven catches for 67 yards.'

S"Tight coverage is Asante Samuel's claim to fame. Though he was manhandled by Roddy White in last week's blowout win in Atlanta, the All-Pro corner should get back on track against Smith. The tacky-handed wideout is undergoing a breakthrough season. His 10.7 points per game average is the 12th-best mark at his position. He has also become a staple in PPR lineups totaling 78 receptions, the fourth-most in the league. But Samuel, who limited Smith to just 68 receiving yards Week 8, is one of the NFL's few shutdown corners. Double-S shouldn't wear street clothes in PPR formats, but in TD-heavy standard leagues, he's an undependable option."

S"On-the-field Houshmandzadeh has had more transgressions than Tiger Woods off. But despite his uncountable number of head-slamming performances, the majority of owners are still idiotically standing by his side. The crown on top of the former consistency king's head is significantly tarnished. He's surpassed the seven-point mark in a game just three times. Matt Hasselbeck still possesses the talents needed to dissect a defense. However, with little time to plant and fire, he's struggled mightily. Houston's pass rush has been inconsistent, but even if the D-line has difficulty penetrating the pocket, the secondary should have much success running press coverage. Even in the deepest of leagues, Housh could tally a big squadoosh."

Since Week 9, he's averaged 5.4 receptions and 67.6 yards per game equal to the seventh-best output at his position. With Darrelle Revis tied up with Antonio Bryant, most would surmise Winslow should accumulate appreciable totals. If the Jets' blitz is unsuccessful, that very easily could happen. But the season trend doesn't lend much support for a banner day. Overall, the Jets have surrendered the fourth-fewest fantasy points to tight ends. Only one monolithic target, Dante Rosario Week 12, has reached the 60-yard mark against them. The aforementioned Boss, Dustin Keller (at TB) and Jermichael Finley (at Chi) are more reliable options."

S'Young is shining up his jingle bells for what will surely be a Vinsane-in-the-membrane performance on Christmas night. Commanding arguably the most dangerous 7-7 team in the AFC Wild Card hunt, the resurgent signal caller has shed his unjustified light-throwing label tossing 249 yards per game with seven touchdowns in his past three. He\'s also chipped in 28 rushing yards per game. Accuracy still isn\'t one of Young\'s strong suits but with first mate, Captain Quick (Chris Johnson), at his disposal a simple five-yard screen can instantly stretch into a 70-yard touchdown. The return of Justin Gage, who snagged two TD passes last week, also enhances his value. The two teams, stemming from a 2007 clash in which Shawne Merriman, who was victimized by an alleged "cheap shot," suffered a devastating knee injury, harbor a great deal of animosity toward one another. Suffice it to say, the two won\'t exchange secret Santa gifts. However, look for Young to deliver plenty of presents. The strides San Diego has made in run defense has come at a vertical cost. Teams, like Cincinnati last week, have bombarded the Chargers. Over the past four weeks, they\'ve allowed 253.8 yards per game and eight touchdowns, including a three-score game to the mighty Brady Quinn. Young will taste candy cane sweet.'

S'Owners who had the foresight to deploy Harrison a week ago hit the (expletive) lottery. His unforgettable 286 rushing yards, the third-best single game effort in NFL history, and TD hat trick will be scrawled down in the annals of fantasy history as the greatest effort 98 percent of owners never benefited from. Incensed readers who sent vitriolic emails to "experts" for their recommendation of Chris Jennings don\'t deserve blame. Augustus Gloop (Eric Mangini) would employ an Oompah Loopmah (not MJD) for a chance to swim in a giant cup of hot coco. But despite Mangenius\' treachery, and presumed voracious appetite, we\'re confident he won\'t demote or consume the record-breaker. Harrison has certainly proven he can be the lead dog. Assuming he nets the start, the versatile Chihuahua should pack a vicious bite versus Oakland. Since Week 11, the Raiders have allowed 4.9 yards per carry, 162 total yards per game and four scores to rushers, equal to the ninth-most fantasy points. Cleveland\'s rapidly improving offensive line should dominate the interior for the third-straight week. Another 30-plus carries is highly unlikely but with 18-22 touches, Harrison should pay a handsome dividend.'

S'Michael Turner is a broken down horse who deserves a trip to the Kibbles n\' Bits factory. Tweaking his ankle yet again last week, the popular early-round pick exited stage left almost immediately. Though the starter is determined not to "shut it down right now," his odds of suiting up Sunday appear long. Enter Snelling. When pressed into starting action, the converted fullback has performed admirably. In the five games in which he\'s garnered at least 10 touches, the bruiser has averaged 78 total yards per game with four scores. The Bills have made some minor improvements in run defense in recent weeks, but they\'are still one of the most vulnerable interior units in the league. On the season they\'ve surrendered 4.9 yards per carry, 188.2 total yards and 1.4 touchdowns per game to rushers, equal to the most fantasy points. Because Mike Smith is dedicated to a ground-pounding approach, Snelling should be leaned on heavily in an attempt to soften Buffalo\'s unyielding pass defense. Start him with confidence.'

S"Despite a cumbersome foot injury, the Bride of Frankenstein has outshined his backfield hetero-life-mate, Brandon Jacobs, over the past several games. His explosiveness, versatility and deceptive power explain why Tom Coughlin and company continue to turn to him, particularly inside the 10. Over the past three weeks, the former seventh-round pick has averaged a terrific 5.1 yards per touch, 79.3 total yards per game and totaled three touchdowns. The Frankensteins should be utilized heavily this week against Carolina. Contrary to their stiff pass defense, the Panthers have underperformed interiorly. Since Week 11, they've surrendered 4.4 yards per carry, 160.8 total yards per game and six TDs to rushers, equal to the fifth-most fantasy points. Eli Manning has been sensational of late, but because the Giants offensive line has rediscovered its hole-creating identity, the run will surely be the featured philosophy. Bradshaw balls."

He and his teammates suffered from a contagious case of the dropsies. However, the silver lining on an otherwise unmemorable day: he attracted 10 targets. Look for RamBowe to have his M-16 locked and loaded this week. Cincinnati's bracket scheme has clamped down on wideouts in recent weeks. Since Week 11, the Bengals have yielded just three 70-yard performances and five touchdowns to wideouts, equal to the ninth-fewest fantasy points. But the Chiefs' top target is one of the league's elite talents. His size, body control and strength are incredibly difficult to contain even when garnering extra attention. Cincy couldn't bottle up similarly skilled pass catchers Calvin Johnson and Vincent Jackson earlier this season. If Matt Cassel can stave off the Bengals pass rush, Bowe should have a fine day."

Hopefully, Braylon's baby's mama demands he never holds the child. Despite his chaotic life away from football, Edwards has occasionally shown flashes of his former All-Pro self. Yes, the long-bomb he botched in Toronto was laughable, but he has splashed pay-dirt in two of his past three games and is coming off his first 100-yard effort since Week 15 last year. Indy's injury ravaged secondary continues to give up noteworthy performances to large targets. Brandon Marshall humiliated the Colts for an NFL record 21 receptions two weeks ago and Mike Sims-Walker tallied 64 yards and a score against them last week. If he coats his hands in Mrs. Butterworth, Edwards could compile superb WR2 numbers. Indy has given up the seventh-most fantasy points to wideouts over the past five weeks."

S"Morgan has always possessed the tools to develop into a premier wideout. But inefficiencies at the quarterback position combined with his slow development have blanketed his abilities. However, Jimmy Raye's axis-tilting shift to a more liberal passing system has greatly enhanced the promising wideout's production and, most importantly, his confidence. Though still minimally owned, the up-and-comer has averaged a healthy 7.3 targets 5.5 receptions and 43.5 yards per game since Week 12. During that stretch, he's also found the end-zone twice. The Niners will likely attack Detroit vertically this week in an attempt to revitalize Alex Smith, who's struggled in his past two contests. The loathsome Lions have allowed nine touchdowns and six 70-yard-plus games to receivers over the past five weeks, equal to the most fantasy points. Morgan may not be a household name yet, but he's a rising young player who's definitely worth the gamble."

S'For months we\'ve speculated about Finley\'s dynamite potential. It appears he\'s finally tapping into it. Despite operating at around "80-85 percent" due to a bum knee, the ultra-talented tight end continues to deliver one headline performance after another. Finley has been Aaron Rodgers\' favorite target over the past five weeks netting 8.2 targets, 6.2 receptions and 60.4 yards per game. He\'s also scored three times. Over that span, only Dallas Clark, Antonio Gates, Vernon Davis and Fred Davis have outpaced the newcomer. Don\'t expect the Cheese Whiz train to slow down anytime soon. After last week\'s embarrassing blowout loss to Tampa, the Hawks have officially packed it in. Dissected vertically, they\'ve conceded numerous explosive plays in recent weeks, including to tight ends. Since Week 11 they\'ve allowed the fifth-most fantasy points to enlarged targets. Defensive coordinators have thrown zone and man coverage at Finley with little success. Corners, who\'ve attempted to jam him at the line, have experienced significant resistance. Because of his mammoth size and considerable athleticism, he is a matchup nightmare. If A-Rod continues to line him up in the crosshairs, he simply won\'t be stopped.'

S"Though Jim Caldwell continues to be vague in regards to starters' playing time, the chances all marquee Colts lay Yule logs this week are solid, including Manning. We've witnessed this scenario unfold before. With Indy's playoff fate determined, Tony Dungy opted to sit his players in '05 and '06. Caldwell, a Dungy disciple, will likely follow the same blueprint. Undoubtedly, Manning will probably play at least the entire first half. But against an unfriendly Jets secondary, starting him is an enhanced risk. Only one quarterback this season, Chad Henne in Week 5, has thrown for multiple touchdowns against them. And only four signal callers - Drew Brees and Matt Schaub not included - have reached the 200-yard mark. Considering the circumstances, history and matchup, it's quite possible Curtis Painter could see extensive action. Play it safe."

S"Jackson must pull Budweiser-stocked carts to stay in shape. The man is a Clydesdale. Heroic is the best word that describes the workhorse's spectacular season. Despite routinely facing overloaded boxes, he continues to thwart opponents. He even stiff-armed the Swine Flu. As Jackson remarked earlier this week he refuses to shut it down. Based on his consistent returns, his passion for playing is evident. Only three times this season he's failed to eclipse 100 total yards in a game. But this week could be the fourth. Arizona has been steamrolled in the trenches over the past two weeks yielding 167 yards to Frank Gore Week 14 and 126 to lowly Maurice Morris last week. But, as Adrian Peterson owners can attest, the Cardinals are fiercer at home allowing just 4.1 yards per carry to rushers. He's impossible to demote, especially in PPR formats, but upstarts Fred Jackson (at Atl), Beanie Wells (vs. StL) and Harrison will likely yield more formidable totals."

S'Start LT on Christmas night and it\'s quite possible he\'ll deposit a lump of coal in your stocking. Coming off his first 100-total yard game of the season, the antiquated back was finally featured prominently in the passing attack. According to Norv Turner, the veteran hasn\'t "lost anything in terms of his receiving ability" - a strange comment considering LT has averaged 1.3 receptions per game. Due to San Diego\'s continued run-blocking inadequacies and the Titans\' growing defensive confidence, the former league MVP should not be trusted. Tennessee\'s run defense has intensified over the past five weeks surrendering just 3.9 yards per carry and 133.8 total yards per game to RBs. In fact, no rusher has reached the 80-yard mark against the Titans since Maurice Jones-Drew gashed them for 177 yards in Week 8. Unless LT again carves out a substantial role in the passing game, which seems very unlikely, another underwhelming total yardage effort is likely. Don\'t let him be your Scrooge.'

S"Shortcomings in short-yardage situations continue to plague the rookie. If you give Moreno an inch, he'll take a centimeter. He's been stopped for negative yards, no gain or 1-yard an astounding 35.2 percent of the time. Josh McDaniels refuses to point an accusatory finger specifically at the youngster commenting earlier this week every component of the rushing offense has failed. The prepubescent coach probably isn't expecting a miraculous turnaround this week in Philly. Sean McDermott's aggressive defense is an intimidating foe. The Eagles have yielded an uncharacteristic 4.3 yards per carry to backs since Week 11, but over that span they've also surrendered just two scores and 128.6 total yards per game, equal to the sixth-fewest fantasy points. Don't bank on Moreno rediscovering his mojo."

S"Nothing says potential fantasy disaster quite like Drew Stanton. The inexperience third-string quarterback is expected to net the start this week in hostile territory. For the third-straight week Megatron may transform into a small-massed object. Hampered by a sore knee and constant double coverage, the unbelievably gifted wideout has vanished. Over the past two weeks he's caught just seven passes for 72 yards. On paper, Niners corner Shawntee Spencer is completely outmatched by Johnson's size and skill set - most corners are. But since he's really Detroit's only reliable offensive weapon, Mike Singletary will devise several strategies to confine the talented receiver. Keep in mind only two receivers have surpassed 70 yards against San Francisco since Week 10."

S"Smith is blessed with Spiderman hands. The sticky-fingered wideout has caught over 66 percent of passes thrown his direction. Because of Eli Manning's pinpoint accuracy, the Giants have resorted to a more aggressive, skyward style over the past several games. However, as we discussed earlier, this matchup sets up nicely for the running game. Carolina has yielded a fair amount of pass yardage (212.8) since Week 11, but few touchdowns. In fact, only three receivers have crossed the chalk against the Panthers this season. Smith is a savvy route-runner who exploits soft spots in coverage with regularity. But Chris Gamble will be a challenge. Only Roddy White and Antonio Bryant have eclipsed the 70-yard mark against him this year. Smith will get his usual 5-6 catches, but his yardage totals probably won't make a major impact."

S'Minus the homophobic slurs, T.O. did his best Larry Johnson Twitter impersonation after last week\'s loss to New England posting "sometimes things must come 2 and end, u hv 2 move on & accept wht life has 2 offer." For those with English degrees who can\'t decipher annoying Twitter shorthand, Owens\' time in Buffalo appears to be short-lived. With only seven catches for 66 yards in his past three games, his frustration is understandable. This week it could reach a crescendo. Atlanta\'s secondary is less than stellar. No unit has allowed more 20-yard pass plays this season. But with performance douser Brian Brohm scheduled to start and the Bills determined to push Fred Jackson over 1,000 yards, Owens will again be forgotten. Just say, ho, ho, no to T.O.'

S"Due to his largely insignificant contributions, He-Man has transformed into She-Ra. Trapped in an offensive wasteland, the highly skilled target has attracted few opportunities. For the most part, his season has been a colossal failure, particularly over the past five weeks. During that stretch he's averaged a mere 3.6 receptions and 22 yards per game. His resulting 2.2 points per game output ranks No. 36 at his position, one spot ahead of fantasy powerhouse Brad Cottam. Despite his dramatic downturn, owners - we can only assume are deceased or out of contention - continue to start him. Olsen compiled a PPR praiseworthy seven catches for 42 yards four weeks ago against the Vikes. But in the rematch little should be expected."

S'Lowdown: After watching their QB hang 363 yards against the supposedly vaunted Titans D, Big Ben owners, too, daydream of conceiving "Little Roethlisbergers." Expect their disturbing thoughts to continue this week in Chicago. The Pittsburgh QB dissected the Titans in the flat and between the hashmarks with surgical precision, connecting with Hines Ward and Heath Miller repeatedly. A similar blueprint could be followed this week against the Urlacher-less Bears. Without its defensive captain and tackling machine lurking across the middle, the Bears\' front seven will likely go-on-the-offensive with numerous twists, stunts and run blitzes, a strategy Roethlisberger is anticipating. If that script is followed, the Steelers spread will prove deadly. Though he will be badgered often, Big Ben\'s uncanny ability to evade danger should produce plentiful explosive pass plays downfield, especially against a shaky secondary. Top five totals could be on the horizon.'

S'Lowdown: Against Rex Ryan\'s stingy Jets defense, the Slasher was more Freddy Mercury than Krueger - sans the greasy \xe2\x80\x98stache and random "Galileo" chirps. Gripping the pigskin a mere 12 times, Slaton finished with a 42 total-yard, 0-touchdown, 1-fumble performance that paralleled his initial effort a year ago (16 touches, 49 total yards, 0 TDs at Pit). But with a road tango with Tennessee up next, Slaton is sharpening his blades. Last season against the Titans, the then rookie compiled 239 yards and a score in two clashes. His 116-yard exhibition was only the 10th time a visiting rusher had eclipsed the century mark in the 10-year history of LP Field. As defensive end Kyle Vanden Bosch remarked earlier this week, constant Slaton surveillance will be a top priority. Despite the run-stopping emphasis, the miniature rusher\'s multipurpose abilities combined with the Texans\' bevy of lethal weapons will once again make it difficult for Tennessee to contain the mighty mite. If you invested a first-round pick in Slaton, this is the week he calms your fears.'

S"Lowdown: Not suffering from a post-Kardashian hangover, the NFL's other running Bush exuded notable power and drive against the Chargers Monday night. In total, the former Louisville standout accumulated 59 total yards and a touchdown on just 13 touches. Tom Cable plans to implement a strict two-back rotation each week, with Darren McFadden being the staple horse. Bush and veteran Justin Fargas will earn roughly 12-15 touches per contest when active. Because Bush performed admirably in his '09 debut, it's likely he and not Fargas will play the role of vice-back this week in KC. Assuming he suits up and nets an identical workload; the third-year bulldozer could again produce wholesome numbers. The Chiefs were dismantled by Ravens rushers a week ago yielding 193 total yards, 4.7 yards per carry and three scores. If Oakland's trench heavyweights dominate the line of scrimmage as they did Week 1, sizeable creases for McFadden and Bush will be plentiful."

Tallying more work than forecasted, the Holistic One compiled 58 yards on nine touches against Atlanta, including a receiving touchdown. Ronnie Brown is clearly the superior option considering Williams\' advanced age (32), but the former Mike Ditka obsession still feels he\'s "explosive." Hosting a Colts defense that surrendered 135 total yards, 4.5 yards per carry and a TD to Jacksonville last week, the Fins will likely prescribe a heavy dose of Brown and Williams to pound the interior. He isn\'t starting material in shallow leagues, but owners with a flex option in more challenging formats should pass the peace pipe.'

Though he totaled a paltry five targets, two receptions and six yards a week ago, the diminutive dynamo believes Randle El's emergence should help free him near the sidelines. Still one of the leagues slipperiest receivers, Moss should have little difficulty maneuvering to voids against the un-dynamic duo of Ronald Bartell and Jonathan Wade. Expect a big bounce-back week."

With Nate Washington nursing a tender hammy, the routinely disrespected former Bear was targeted 11 times, catching seven passes for 78 yards and a score in Pittsburgh. Though Jeff Fisher's conservative offensive philosophy will occasionally limit Gage's looks, he is reliable play against flexible defenses, especially this week. Versus the Jets Week 1, the Texans conceded 154 yards and a TD to Mark Sanchez's wideouts. Considering the strong chemistry between Collins and Gage, look for the graybeard to line up No. 12 in the sights early and often. After missing Week 1 with a leg injury, Houston's top cover corner Jacques Reeves is expected to return, but Gage's towering height and smooth route-running outclasses the Texans coverman on paper."

S"Lowdown: The Professor, who wants to work toward a Ph. D in sociology once he finishes his post-graduate work at Vandy, is, in all facets, definitely the yin to brain surgeon Devin Hester's yang. Attracting 13 targets last week in the Bears' futile display in Green Bay (7 receptions, 66 yards), he was clearly Jay Cutler's weapon of choice in short routes across-the-middle and on the peripheries. Minus premiere receiver stalker Troy Polamalu, the Steelers showed marked vulnerability through the air against a largely mediocre Tennessee passing attack. Overall, the unit yielded 20 catches, 266 yards and a touchdown to powder blue wideouts, the third-worst performance of Week 1. To refine the passing game and establish an early rhythm, Ron Turner will likely call numerous high percentage passes, many of which will head toward Bennett. Start him with confidence as a WR3 in deeper formats, especially those which score favorably for receptions."

S'Lowdown: No longer decomposing, the "Trash" Heap has risen from the fantasy grave. Healthy for the first time in two seasons, the once dependable No. 1 tight end was magnificent in opening week action catching five passes for 74 yards and a touchdown. Joe Flacco and John Harbaugh\'s growing confidence in Heap could resurrect his sliding career. This week matched against a San Diego defense that has surrendered the most fantasy points to tight ends over the past three seasons, the injury prone target could imitate Zach Miller. On Monday night, JaMarcus Russell\'s safety valve snagged six passes for 96 yards against the Chargers. Count on Heap for top-five totals (Sidebar: That was extremely difficult to type).'

S"Lowdown: Gimpy, bewildered and generally maladroit, Palmer's 247-yard, 2 interception effort against Denver was a laughable, Fitzpatrick-esque performance. Under Dom Caper's tutelage, the Packers brilliant transition to the 3-4 defense has been seamless. Pressuring Jay Cutler into risky throws a week ago, they will likely institute a similar gameplan against Cincy's rickety offensive line. Because Palmer's mobility is very limited due to the lingering effects of a high ankle sprain, he will be a sitting duck in the backfield. Throw in the blanketing prowess of Charles Woodson and Al Harris, and the Bengals' aerial woes will likely extend another week. However, we're really hoping for an Ochocinco Lambeau Leap."

S"Lowdown: Pugnacious last week against the Hawks, Jackson is already frustrated. His outward conentiousness is understandable. To put it mildly, the Rams are the NFL's version of the Bad News Bears. The two-time All-Pro is undoubtedly, Steve Spagnuolo's most damaging weapon, but with defenses keying on him, and the gross defensive inadequacies of the Rams, it will be tough-sledding for the popular first-round selection. Battling arguably the NFC's finest offensive line, the Redskins contained the Giants rushing attack last week, holding the Frankensteins to just 3.8 yards per carry and 134 total yards. With man-eater Albert Haynesworth clogging the lane, it will be extremely difficult for the Rams rusher to find running lanes. However, because Spags will likely want to work away from the interior, Jackson could be a dependable receptions source this week, meaning he shouldn't be demoted in PPR-intensive formats."

S"Lowdown: In Indianapolis, it's the same, tired 3.0 yards per carry story on the ground. Though Addai totaled an appreciable 77 yards and splashed pay-dirt against the Jags, the Colts offensive line struggled mightily to create rushing avenues. Left tackle Charlie Johnson believes the trench issues will be resolved once the O-line plows through the mental roadblocks. Still the odds of a rapid turnaround this week are long. The Fins, coming off a masterful performance against Michael Turner, appear to be one of the AFC's stingiest run defenses. Paul Pasqualoni's base 3-4 limited last year's fantasy darling to 65 yards on 22 carries (2.9 ypc). With Donald Brown also vying for touches, Addai is destined to disappoint. Trust the veteran rusher only as a flex option in PPR formats."

But its imperative owners understand his 143-yard performance came against the Lions, a team a blind, three-legged Chihuahua could shred. A full participant in practice this week, the heavily-braced Pierre Thomas is determined to return to action. Idiotically discarded by many in Fantasyland, its absurd how quickly owners have forgotten about the PT Cruiser's stirring run to end '08. Bell and Thomas will compete for touches going forward, which complicates their points-scoring potential. Due to the circumstances and unfavorable Week 2 matchup, any Saints back, including Reggie Bush, is untrustworthy. The Eagles suffocated one of the league's more potent rushing offenses, Carolina, last week, limiting Panthers tugboats to just 2.7 yards per carry. Your opportunity to maximize profit on Bell is about to vanish."

S"Lowdown: Graduate of the Kanye West School of the Jackass Arts, Marshall was uncharacteristically quiet both verbally and statistically in his '09 debut at Cincinnati. Targeted seven times by Kyle Orton, he caught only four passes for 27 yards. Frankly, his biggest contribution was assisting Brandon Stokley's Mile High Miracle. Possibly a result of not having a comfortable grasp of the playbook, the perennial 100-catch threat looked lost often. With Eddie Royal and the ground game expected to be the focus of Denver's scheme this week, Marshall could once again wander off into space. Pulverized by Adrian Peterson Week 1, the Browns could be this year's Broncos. Recall last year, the My Little Ponies were so repulsive against the run, it made the secondary appear stouter on paper than it truly was. Until Marshall wears gloves comprised of double-sided tape, he's bench material."

S"Lowdown: Despite reaching double-digits in targets (10), White notched a very quiet five catches for 42 yards Week 1 versus Miami. Expect the Falcons' No. 1 to have another wingless performance. Last season against Carolina, Hot Roddy failed to rev his engine. In two contests, he totaled a marginal 11 catches for 160 yards and zero touchdowns. Though the lopsided result may indicate otherwise, corners Chris Gamble and Richard Marshall played admirably against the Eagles, limiting Philly receivers to just six catches for 59 yards. Also, it's important to keep in mind the Panthers' recent problems containing tight ends. Tony Gonzalez will surely wrest away looks. White shouldn't be benched in PPR formats, but another disappointing effort in standard leagues is a very real possibility."

S"Lowdown: Other than a nifty TD scamper on special teams, Jackson performed deplorably in Carolina totaling just two catches for nine yards. Because Donovan McNabb's status is still very cloudy, the chances of a strong D-Jack rebound appear unfavorable. Kevin Kolb has a noodle arm. His inability to deliver crisp, clean passes downfield severely hinders the deep-threat's potential. Marty Morninweg will likely design numerous quick-step drops for Kolb to curtail errant passes. Considering Jackson's dynamite yards-after-catch skills he could prove lethal when given space. Still the situation is not conducive for a banner fantasy day. A more conservative scheme could be installed in an attempt to take the air out of Drew Brees. Play it safe."

S"Lowdown: Shackled by the G-Men recently, Witten has massively underperformed against the Boys' archrival. Over the past two seasons, the oversized target has failed to surpass the 50-yard mark in three of four contests against New York. The Giants secondary was feasted on by the injury imp Week 1, but, despite allowing seven catches for 68 yards and a score to Chris Cooley, the linebacker corps looked strong. Due to NY's possible defensive limitations, Roy Williams, Patrick Crayton and Miles Austin are poised to contribute significantly. Obviously, you're not benching one of fantasy's premiere tight ends in any format, but a mediocre effort could be forthcoming (Sidebar: If the Noise misfires on another Cowboy, Big D fans are welcome to vandalize my lawn)."

S"Scoreboards haven't spontaneously exploded in the rookie's presence, but in just two starts he's accomplished more than quarterbacks in destitute pigskin lands Oakland, Cleveland and Fitzpatrick Heights. Though he's completed just 50.8 percent of his attempts, Freeman has exhibited a fearless attitude. His smooth mechanics and astute pocket awareness point to Pro Bowl caliber seasons ahead. Over the past two weeks he's averaged a respectable 14.3 points per game in standard formats, netting 200.5 passing and 27.5 rushing yards per game with four touchdowns. That output could rise this week against a New Orleans defense minus starting corners Tracy Porter and Jabari Greer. Their absence combined with Tampa's defensive inefficiencies and the expected return of Antonio Bryant suggest Freeman could be leaned on heavily. The Saints have allowed 249.8 passing yards and five touchdowns to gunslingers since Week 6. A Shocker Special worthy performance just outside the QB top 10 is fathomable."

For The Director, the Lions' pliable offensive line has cramped his scoring style \xe2\x80\x93 he hasn't crossed the chalk since Week 4. He also hasn't eclipsed the century mark in six straight.

Tim Hightower will still rack most touches inside the 5, but it's clear Ken Whisenhunt is committed to establishing a hardnosed power running game. Wells should again net roughly 14-17 touches this week in St. Louis. The repulsive Rams have surrendered 4.8 yards per carry, 179.8 total yards per game and seven scores to rushers over the past five weeks, equal to the second-most fantasy points allowed.

S'Reading between the lines it\'s very apparent Gary Kubiak wants Slaton to reestablish his position as the team\'s best back. Over the bye week, The Slasher worked extensively to solve his menacing case of fumblitis watching video of Tiki Barber, who conquered the affliction several years ago. Earlier this week, Arian Foster was promoted from the practice squad and is expected to get reps alongside Slaton, Ryan Moats and Chris Brown. Obviously, Houston\'s backfield is crowded, but the incumbent\'s diligence will be rewarded. Assuming Bud Adams\' cretaceous-aged "birds" aren\'t a distraction; expect the former Mountaineer to tote roughly 60 percent of the workload with much success. The Titans have yielded a ridiculous 7.9 yards per carry, 187.3 total yards per game and five scores to rushers over the past five weeks, equal to the fifth-most fantasy points allowed. Your chances of buying low are rapidly shrinking.'

S"In terms of recent production, the top-heavy Breaston is the Katherine Heigl of fantasy wideouts. Quietly over the past five weeks he's splashed pay-dirt four times averaging 6.2 targets, 4.6 receptions and 60.4 yards per game, the 11th-best output at his position. Kurt Warner has threaded footballs through pinholes of late. Given the accommodating matchup against his old club, the Sultan of Stubble should have little trouble spreading the love to Larry Fitzgerald, Anquan Boldin and Breaston. Because offenses have pounded the Rams between the hashmarks, only four receivers have eclipsed the 70-yard mark against them since Week 6. But despite the Cardinals' advancing ground game, they're still a pass-first team. Expect the recipient of Warner's 199th career TD pass to again post sneaky good numbers."

S'For Terrell Owens supporters, the phrase "getting Fitzpatricked" is the real-life equivalent of probing-by-cattle-prod. However, for Evans backers, the phrase has a more positive meaning. The inconsistent wideout has done some of his finest work this season with the backup behind center. From Weeks 6-8, the combo connected for 11 receptions for 172 yards and two scores (22 targets). With Skeletor (Dick Jauron) no longer a threat to Eternia, new head coach Perry Fewell has made it clear he wants to feature the Fred Jackson-led Wildcat more often. Despite the Bills\' presumed shift to a more ground-centered style, Evans should still pay an appreciable dividend this week in Jacksonville. The Jags have allowed five TDs and four 70-yard-plus performances to receivers over the past five weeks.'

S"In the Rams' surprisingly competitive clash with New Orleans last week, Avery was an unforeseen fantasy stud totaling 67 yards and two touchdowns. Finally healthy, the fleet-footed wideout should continue his recent run of success. For the most part, Arizona's secondary has been rocky this season. Cards corners have conceded the seventh-most fantasy points to WRs. 'Zona is an aggressive bunch who relishes ramping up pressure on the pocket. Under normal circumstances, Marc Bulger would be swallowed whole by the blitz, but the Rams' offensive line has made significant strides in pass protection in recent weeks. Last week against New Orleans, the QB was sacked just twice. If the Rams can continue to hold their blocks, Avery's chances of a repeat performance are better than you think"

S'Striving to "be the best, plain and simple," Winslow has flourished with an inexperienced quarterback at the wheel. Over the past two weeks the former motorcycle stuntman has attracted 16 targets, catching 11 passes for 159 yards and a touchdown, his best two-game stretch this season. Another banner effort could be on tap against a stiff Saints unit. Through nine weeks, no oversized target has scored on New Orleans. But as Brent Celek (8-104 Week 2) and Tony Gonzalez (6-89 Week 8) proved earlier this year, talented tight ends who are heavily involved in their team\'s gameplan can pierce Gregg Williams\' unit. Anticipate another double-digit point performance from the budding Winslow.'

S"This week the raging Rivers calms. San Diego's slinger has played brilliantly in recent weeks, threading the needle with incredible precision. But on-field accuracy hasn't necessarily translated to giant fantasy gains. Since Week 6 he ranks 10th in points per game at his position, averaging 246.2 yards per game with 10 touchdowns. In his last meeting with Denver five weeks ago, he notched a mediocre 274 yards and a touchdown. This time around, the conclusion could be blander. After dropping three straight, the Broncos are desperate to regain supremacy in the AFC West. The Chargers will likely lean on LT early to set up play-action, but if the ground game stalls, San Diego could struggle vertically. The Broncos' high-pressure blitz scheme may also hinder Rivers' statistical performance. Only sit Rivers if you have dependable alternatives, but the tea leaves suggest a vanilla effort. Denver has yielded just 218.8 passing yards per game in its past five contests."

S'Aging with the grace of Andie MacDowell (She\'s really 51?), Jones has greatly exceeded his Round 4 draft day value, especially of late. Over his past five contests, the 31-year-old has averaged 5.3 yards per carry, 139.5 total yards per game and scored three times, good for the sixth-best output among rushers. New England has been somewhat friendly to RBs in recent weeks, surrendering 4.6 yards per carry since Week 6. But despite giving up occasional big runs, only two rushers, Ray Rice and Chris Johnson, have surpassed the 90-yard mark against them. Physically, Jones recently declared he "feels like a rookie." Running behind one of the league\'s best offensive lines can have that effect. But absent a consistent vertical attack from the Jets, New England will likely suffocate the veteran in Foxboro. Week 2 against the intradivisional foe, Jones totaled just 54 yards on 14 carries.'

S"Chicago's ineffectiveness pounding the pigskin is, in Bears fans' eyes, a bigger crisis than the terrifying Eggo shortage that has gripped the nation (What will Mrs. Butterworth do?). Forte's situation is sticky, to say the least. Evident in last week's game in San Fran, the Bears' offensive line is a sieve. Forte finished with a pathetic 41 yards on 20 carries. Fortunately, the former Tulane star saved face with his versatility, catching eight passes for 120 yards. When provided space he's been assertive, racking significant yardage in the passing game. More of the same should be expected this week against Philly. The Eagles, humiliated by LT last week in San Diego, are looking to regain their edge. Over the past five weeks, they've allowed just 3.8 yards per carry to backs, but five touchdowns. Forte will again be an asset as a receiver, making him indispensable in PPR leagues, but another marginal effort in standard formats is on the horizon."

S"In the land of artery clogging dairy products, Grant has curdled. Though he's averaged a healthy 4.4 yards per carry average over the past five weeks, he's found the end zone just twice since Week 3. Suffice it to say, the Packers' offensive line has limited his fantasy potential. Against the Niners' formidable front seven, the rusher could again tally sour numbers. Since Week 6, San Fran has surrendered a mere 3.5 yards per carry, 124 total yards per game and four scores to backs. If Aaron Rodgers is clicking in the passing game early, don't be surprised if Mike McCarthy shies away from the run. Grant is one of the few remaining workhorses still kicking in an era of split backfields. But even with a steady 20-carry diet, he's only proven trustworthy against loose defenses."

S"The Skywalker Show may be deceased, but the Jacksonville upstart is still an Internet sensation. That is, in virtual pigskin circles. Staving off the deadly Darrelle Disease last week in New York, Sims-Walker cracked eggs on the faces of fantasy pundits totaling 49 yards and a touchdown. You'd think we learned our lesson, but the Bills aren't exactly the friendliest of matchups. Glancing at the numbers, most football fans would surmise Buffalo's struggles stopping the run have artificially enhanced its secondary's stoutness. But that's not entirely the case. Safety Jairus Byrd has been magnificent, totaling seven interceptions this season. Due to Maurice Jones-Drew's presence, the Jags will focus on the run, stymieing MSW's chances for a noteworthy fantasy day. Keep in mind, the Bills have allowed the second-fewest fantasy points to wideouts since Week 6."

S"For those who invested fat coin in Jennings, it's been a frustrating year. Outplayed by ageless teammate Donald Driver, the popular early round pick ranks just 28th among wideouts in overall production. Now bothered by a knee contusion, his value could decline further this week against the Niners. San Fran has occasionally been dissected vertically this year (i.e. Roddy White Week 5), but the Niners have generally defended the pass well. Over the past five weeks, the Gold Panners have yielded just one touchdown and two 70-yard receiver performances, equal to the seventh-fewest fantasy points allowed. Considering Jennings has netted the 36th-best ppg mark since Week 6, Driver may once again overshadow him."

S"It's perplexing why the majority of fantasy owners continue to support Harvin as an every week start. It's understandable if your league scores favorably for return yards, but in standard formats he's more of the stream-type. Since Week 6, he hasn't registered top 40 numbers. Vikes' fans have clamored for Harvin to see more action, but Brad Childress remains committed to a limited workload. The rookie, who's battled through a shoulder injury, migraine headaches and an unknown sickness, hasn't exactly been healthy. On paper, Harvin's matchup with the Hawks is very enticing. Seattle has conceded the second-most fantasy points to wideouts in their past five contests. But Harvin's limited looks combined with Brett Favre's mancrush on Sidney Rice could again push the youngster into the background. Expect another snoozer."

When featured prominently, Witten has done what he's always done, catch everything in sight. But due to the aforementioned ground troubles and Tony Romo's increased dependability on Roy Williams and Miles Austin, he's become an auxiliary option. On the season he ranks just 17th at his position in points per game. Toss in Washington's No. 4 ranking against tight ends this season, and Witten's star is bound to fade once again."

But coming off a fine performance at Houston (214 pyds, 29 rshyds, TD), he should be a trustworthy start in a bye-heavy week. Because Kyle Vanden Bosch and his trench cohorts haven't even allowed a porcupine to pierce the frontline, teams have picked on the Titans' shaky secondary. As a result, Tennessee has yielded 297 passing yards per game and seven vertical strikes equal to the second-most fantasy points surrendered. Throw in Jacksonville's defensive shortcomings, and Garrard should manufacture a smooth, not skunky, taste in Week 4."

The Alabama Slamma', an intimidating man to tackle, runs with incredible, bone-crushing power, which he displayed routinely during the preseason (Highlights here). Injured incumbent Frank Gore possesses more explosiveness and versatility, but Coffee fits ideally into Jimmy Raye's pound-you-into-submission scheme. St. Louis has performed marginally against the run, surrendering 4.2 yards per carry, 143.7 total yards per game and three scores to backs this season. However, the Rams haven't faced an offensive line that matches San Fran's in size and skill. Mike Singletary and Raye will not stray away from the Niners' smash-mouth style. Though he had difficulty penetrating the Williams Wall in Minnesota last week, Coffee is bound to percolate with roughly 20-25 carries."

Balanced, deceptively powerful tender-handed and quick through the hole, he's averaged an appreciable 70.3 total yards per game and 6.4 yards per touch. This week against susceptible Seattle, the youngster should be relied on as an RB2 in deeper formats. Gashed repeatedly by the run, the Hawks have conceded 5.6 yards per carry, 168.3 total yards per game and three TDs to rushers this season. Brown may post lackluster numbers early, but once Indianapolis builds an insurmountable lead he'll be employed to slam the door late. Keep in mind Seattle may again be without the services of defensive stalwarts Lofa Tatupu and Leroy Hill."

S'Our obsession for Rush-ard, though significantly milder when compared to the PT Bruiser, is well-documented. Still the former Illinois standout has produced blandly on the field in his early career. Scrawling repeatedly "I will never put forth a half-assed effort again" on the chalkboard in detention last week, Mendenhall is motivated to prove his mettle. With Willie Parker, who missed practice Wednesday, in considerable "pain" due to a plaguing turf toe injury, the restricted rusher may be elevated from doghouse to penthouse if the incumbent is a late scratch. Though Mewelde Moore would also see a sharp increase in playing time, the second-year back\'s plowing interior style is a better fit given the matchup. Sans Jamaal Williams, the Chargers are very pliable inside. On the season, they\'ve allowed 4.6 yards per carry, 187.7 total yards per game and four scores to RBs equal to the third-most fantasy points yielded. If Parker is unavailable or severely limited, Mendenhall is a risky pick who could turn an excellent profit. However, Pittsburgh\'s suspect offensive line must perform at least respectably.

S"In Medieval times, garlic cloves, pockets full of posies and bizarre bird-inspired costumes were thought to ward off the Black Death. Different from the past, targeting Walter is Houston's remedy of choice. With premiere cover corner Nnamdi Asomugha blanketing Andre Johnson, the Texans' crafty No. 2 will have a chance at redemption after he nullified a game-tying touchdown due to a pass interference call. Though his infraction was costly in real football, virtual gamers relished - in his Battle Red/Swedish Fish duds no-less - his 7-catch, 96-yard, 1-TD return to the starting lineup. No. 2 targets have performed 73.8 percent below the league average against the Raiders according to Football Outsiders, but this week will be an exception. "

S'Everyone\'s favorite fantasy "Jackass" hasn\'t taken emasculating pool-ball shots to the groin to gain attention - the numbers have done the talking. One of the surprise sensations of the early season, Knox has performed at a top-20 level averaging 5.3 targets and 53 yards per game with two total touchdowns. The rookie from tiny Abilene Christian, whose been unfazed by the spotlight of Chicago, has exhibited marked poise, open-field elusiveness and, most noticeably, speed. Raw entering the season, Knox has garnered praise from Lovie Smith for his route-running and steady production. Matched against an improving, but still very vulnerable Detroit defense, he\'s must start material. The Lions have surrendered two 100-yard wideouts and five scores to WRs equal to the fourth-most fantasy points allowed. Jay Cutler will continue to spread-the-wealth, but due to the user-friendly matchup, the youngster is destined to notch his third-straight profitable effort. '

S"This past offseason, Stuckey worked diligently with former Atlanta standout Terrance Mathis on several technical pass catching elements in an attempt to diversify his usefulness. In spurts, the hard work has paid off. Interchanging between the slot and flanker positions, New York's No. 2 has performed admirably, catching 10 passes for 112 yards and a touchdown. Because Stuckey has attracted 45.5 percent of his team's targets inside the 20, the second-highest mark in the league, his chances of splashing pay-dirt are enhanced, especially this week. The Jets defense has played at an incredibly high level, but it will be extremely difficult for them to shackle New Orleans' high-octane offense at home. In what could become a shootout, the Dirty One (Mark Sanchez) may be forced to turn to the air to keep pace, increasing Stuckey's chances of a marquee afternoon. Expect a similar tally as Week 1."

S'With Michael Crabtree burning stacks of Benjamins to keep warm, Davis, who\'s finally matured mentally, is blossoming with additional targets in Jimmy Raye\'s conservative system. Coming off his greatest fantasy performance as a pro (7 rec, 96 yds, 2 TDs at Min), the click-clacking tight end should again post elite position numbers. The Rams, who inadequately contained John Carlson and Chris Cooley earlier this season, have surrendered the fourth-most fantasy points to tight ends this year. Davis, never short on confidence, claims he\'s "just scratching the surface right now." Based on Shaun Hill\'s comfort level with him and his cerebral advancements, this might be the year the former first rounder finally lives up to the hype. Hey, the Noise tried to tell you.'

S"Subjected to the incessant hype machine's constant No. 4 coverage, owners, fed up with the inescapable coverage, will likely sledgehammer their plasma screens come MNF. Though Favre has shined under the primetime lights numerous times in the past and is motivated to drive the dagger deeper into the backs of Green Bay management, he isn't someone to trust, even in a heavy bye week. The Packers have already picked off opposing signal callers seven times this season and tallied 23 passes defended, tops in the NFL. They've also limited quarterbacks to just 216.3 yards per game. Due to his accuracy concerns and Green Bay's recent difficulties containing Adrian Peterson, it will be a hand-off fest for Favre. If he turns to the air, don't be surprised if Charles Woodson and company pick him off multiple times. Ignore the temptation. A second consecutive 300-yard game is a long-shot."

S'The Drag Queen of Mean hasn\'t flipped his wig yet over Washington\'s plodding offense. In fact, he confidently boasted this week "it\'s only a matter of time before I have a 200-yard, 150-yard or 2-3 touchdown game." Obviously suffering from a severe case of dementia, Portis hasn\'t grasped what the rest of the football world has: the Redskins are a sordid mess. Although the Bucs have surrendered 5.1 yards per carry, 177.7 total yards per game and two scores to plowshares, the \xe2\x80\x98Skins\' O-line has performed disastrously. Few sizable holes have been opened. Portis has averaged just 3.9 yards per carry and 69.3 total yards per game. And that includes a detestable effort against the Lions (12-42, 1-6, 0 tds). Until the \xe2\x80\x98Skins distance themselves from mediocrity, the outspoken rusher will continue to be a fantasy failure.  '

S'The Long Gain Rice, an innocent victim of continuous Willis McGahee goal-line poaches, finally punctured the end zone last week in Cleveland. Currently the 18th-best rusher in fantasy averaging a terrific 5.1 yard per carry and 93.7 total yards per game, Andy Behrens\' ultimate mantasy may post nightmarish totals at Foxboro. The Pats have conceded just 3.9 yards per carry, 127.5 total yards per game and two scores to rushers this season. If Vincent Wilfork, who is nursing a sprained left ankle, is unavailable, Rice\'s chances of further damaging the Noise\'s already tarnished reputation will increase. The Ravens offensive line has played spectacularly thus far, but Beelzechick, who is determined to draw up a gameplan to limit placing his defenders to make "one-on-one open-space tackles," shouldn\'t be underestimated. McGahee is a safe play, but Rice, who has to reach the bleachers to maximize his fantasy potential in non-PPR formats, is unquestionably riskier in shallow formats.'

S'Lynch, who is reportedly still the "same ol\' G" coming off a three-game suspension, is ready to strike fear into the hearts of scantily clad female beachgoers the winless Fins. Or is he? Due to Fred Jackson\'s stellar play in Beast Mode\'s absence, Dick Jauron plans to "evenly distribute" the workload between the tandem. Expected to be "weaned" in initially, Lynch is unreliable this week because of the uncertainties surrounding his touch total. Miami\'s superb run defense only complicates matters. The Dolphins have yielded a mere 3.2 yards per carry and 104 total yards per games to backs equal to the 10th-fewest fantasy points allowed. Though he still could post user-friendly totals as a flex option in PPR formats, Lynch shouldn\'t be inserted into starting lineups except in the deepest of leagues.'

S"Confining some of the game's most electric talent, including Andre Johnson and Randy Moss, Darrelle Revis is quickly becoming the league's most daunting shutdown corner. Through three games, QBs have completed just 48 percent of their passes intended for targets blanketed by the suffocating defender. For the serial fantasy killer, Colston could become victim No. 4. Over the first three weeks, the Saints' top target has averaged seven targets, five receptions, 65 yards and totaled three touchdowns, the most among wideouts in the league. But with a plethora of reliable weapons at his disposal, Colston could be thrust into decoy duties to isolate Revis. It's extremely difficult to demote a top-10 commodity, but don't be surprised if the lengthy target suffers from a deadly case of Gang Green."

S'Shutout last week against Cincinnati, Holmes is hoping for a major rebound in Week 4. However, the Chargers\' dynamic defending duo, Quentin Jammer and Antonio Cromartie, is one of the league\'s best. Per Football Outsiders, No. 1 wideouts have performed 39.1 percent below the league average against the tag-team. On the season, only one receiver has eclipsed the 60-yard mark against San Diego. Holmes reportedly was unimpressed with the Chargers secondary calling Jammer and Cromartie "normal corners." Facing Oakland and Miami definitely skews the numbers a bit, but the Bolt\'s secondary is stifling. Holmes should register at least a couple catches, but a vanilla effort could be on the horizon.'

S"The apple of Seneca Wallace's eye a week ago, Burleson recorded his highest receptions total since November 14, 2004 (9). Expected to play second fiddle to TJ Houshmandzadeh entering '09, the veteran has become the center of attention vertically averaging 11 targets per game, which ranks third behind Randy Moss and Steve Smith (Car). Despite the Colts' interior deficiencies, they've defended the pass stiffly this season, limiting receivers to just one TD. They've also conceded only four 20-yard pass plays, the fewest in the league. With Wallace expected to be behind center gain Burleson will entice appreciable looks, but against Indy's swarming Cover 2, he will have little space to operate after the catch. PPR leaguers should still employ his services, but standard followers need to install a contingency plan."

S'Winslow, who will one day pitch "cat" products alongside Reggie Bush, was called out by Bucs head coach Raheem Morris last week for failing to turn upfield on a critical third-and-5. Finishing with three catches for 14 yards, his owners, too, publicly lashed out against him. With unpolished quarterback Josh Johnson behind center, Winslow could again underwhelm. Though the green slinger could establish an instant rapport with his tight end, the matchup isn\'t conducive for favorable fantasy results. Monolithic targets have snagged just nine passes against the Redskins this season. Zach Miller (at Hou), Heath Miller (vs. SD) and Todd Heap (at NE) are wiser alternatives.'

"Comfortable operating in a hurry-up type of pace," according to TJ Houshmandzadeh, the veteran QB should have marked success pushing the pedal to the metal against a very vulnerable Arizona secondary. The Cards have allowed a ridiculous 310.3 passing yards and 2.3 air strikes per game equal to the third-most fantasy points yielded. Hassy has also compiled seven touchdowns in two home games. The signal caller, in the midst of an incredibly friendly matchup slate (Next seven: Ari, Bye, at Dal, Det, at Ari, at Min, at StL), could be one of fantasy\'s most valuable QBs over the next several weeks. Sage owners should pitch an offer for his services now before the sticker price soars.'

S'It\'s common knowledge the Noise is perpetually hammered on PT Bruiser juice. But speaking from an objective point of view, he\'s must start material in Week 7. The news of Mike Bell\'s return has once again caused PT supporters to feel uneasy. Thomas\' perplexing ankle/hamstring issues also complicates matters. But there is no reason to panic. Though Bell played marvelously in Thomas\' absence earlier this season, the Bruiser has found the end-zone three times averaging a stupid 6.4 yards per carry and 87.3 total yards per game in three contests. To keep his backfield fresh, Saints coach Sean Payton will install a rotation of sorts, likely riding, as Jeff Duncan of the Times-Picayune speculates, the "hot hand." Unless his ankle soreness intensifies, Thomas should be trusted this week against a deceptively solid Giants frontline. The G-Men have surrendered the fifth-fewest fantasy points to rushers, but also 4.5 yards per carry. Because of Drew Brees\' ability to thin out the box, the PT Bruiser, assuming he\'s healthy, should roll.'

S'New York\'s little Leprechaun has yet to find gold at the end of the rainbow. Rex Ryan and Brian Schottenheimer have repeatedly said Washington will become a centerpiece of the Jets\' gameplan, but seemingly every week they are "disappointed" by the back\'s lack of involvement. On the season, he\'s averaged just 62 total yards per contest and has yet to splash pay-dirt. However, this week, the versatile rusher should inflict significant damage on approximately 15-20 touches. Decimated by injuries, the Bills defense is a very vulnerable unit in all facets, especially on the ground. Buffalo has yielded 4.6 yards per carry, 171.8 total yards per game and eight touchdowns to RBs equal to the fourth-most fantasy points conceded. If there was ever a week to march with Washington, Week 6 is it.'

S"The animated mini-keg, who was voted the third most-underrated player in the NFL by his peers last week, has been grossly underutilized since LT's return. Used sparingly against Pittsburgh just before the Bolts' bye, he touched the rock just one time for a 16-yard reception. Though Tomlinson will tote the lion's share of carries this week against the unblemished Broncos, Sproles' role should expand. Interiorly the Broncos are an inflexible unit, yielding just 3.3 yards per carry to rushers. But, as Tashard Choice, Cedric Benson and Sammy Morris have showed, they are exploitable in space, especially on the peripheries. Denver has allowed 6.4 receptions and 50.2 receiving yards per game to backs this season, the fifth-most in the NFL. To take advantage of what the defense gives him, Philip Rivers will likely target Sproles on several swings and screens. In a more involved role, the Pocket Rocket should accumulate appreciable totals in PPR-intensive formats."

S"Against an underachieving Baltimore secondary, the BB Gun is cocked, locked and loaded. The Larry King of quarterbacks, Brett Favre, who Berrian gifted a rocking chair to for his 40th birthday, admitted earlier this week he's still learning each of his receivers' habits and tendencies. Targeting Berrian 6.6 times per contest, the elderly gunslinger appears comfortable with his primary deep threat despite the learning curve. This week, the two should connect on at least one long bomb. The Ravens have struggled in man-on-man coverage this season, especially downfield. Ed Reed and his cohorts have surrendered an uncharacteristic seventeen 20-yard pass plays, the second-most in the league. They've also conceded the 10th most fantasy points to wideouts. Like Berrian, Percy Harvin and Sidney Rice could also easily achieve flame status, but the BB Gun should have the finest fantasy day of the trio."

S"Avery's Tootsie Roll after scoring a meaningless touchdown last week against Minnesota is the everyday equivalent of breaking out the running man at funerals, high-powered business meetings and encounters with law enforcement. In other words, it was totally inappropriate, though somewhat understandable. Really, how many times will Avery, or any Ram for that matter, find the end zone? Despite St. Louis' general offensive ineptitude, it could have some success vertically this week against Jacksonville. The Jags have allowed the most yards, second-most scores and second-most fantasy points to receivers this season. With Marc Bulger back behind center and given the Rams' inefficiencies defensively, Avery should again attract ample targets, labeling him an upside WR3 in deeper formats. Another 80-plus yard effort could be on the horizon."

S'The Jerry Garcia of NFL receivers, Washington, who will be selling autographed tie-dye shirts and incense on a Foxboro street corner after Sunday\'s game, remarked this week despite the Titans winless record, his teammates are, positively and negatively, motivated by "love." Pass the bong, dude. Due to Tennessee\'s stiffness in the trenches and inadequacies in downfield coverage, quarterbacks have feasted vertically on the Titans which has forced Jeff Fisher to abandon the run, a common occurrence that has benefited Washington. Ranked No. 39 in points per games at his position, the former Steeler has averaged 7.4 targets per game and totaled three touchdowns. Just three receivers have surpassed 80-yards against the Pats, but in a game in which Tennessee could once again be buried early, the Titans\' top target should be thrust into an opportunity to rack numerous catches.'

Though he hasn't crossed the chalk since Week 2 and has failed to eclipse the 50-yard mark in four consecutive games, the Ravens skyscraper should flirt with the tight end top-five this week. In terms of TE defense, Minnesota is the new San Diego. Susceptible across the middle, the Vikings have yielded 7.6 receptions, 93.6 yards and 0.80 touchdowns per game to monolithic targets equal to the most fantasy points allowed. Even the Rams were successful in TE conversions last week totaling eight catches for 90 yards. Activate Heap in all formats."

S'On the WWE circuit, Big Ben may one day unleash the "Slamburger" on opponents, but this week against the run-vulnerable Browns, he won\'t be worthy of a shot at the Intercontinental Belt. Because adversaries have pounded the Puppies into the ground, the Steelers\' intradivisional rival has surrendered just 220.2 yards per game and a 5:2 TD:INT split to QBs equal to the ninth-fewest fantasy points allowed. Bruce Arians may install a conservative approach early to attack Cleveland\'s primary weakness. At Big Ben\'s expense, Rashard Mendenhall and, to a much lesser extent, Willie Parker will undoubtedly run uninhibited. If the ground game is successful early, Pittsburgh could build an insurmountable lead, which would limit Roethlisberger\'s scoring opportunities. Assuming this scenario unfolds, the aforementioned Hasselbeck (vs. Ari), Flacco (at Min) and Brett Favre (vs. Bal) are sounder options.'

S'LT, traveling down the Shaun Alexander path of rapid decline, is a shell of his former self. Prior to the Chargers\' bye, the multi-time All-Pro admitted he was still "a little rusty" against the Steelers. Now close to 100 percent, he will likely total roughly 15-20 carries against Denver. However, due to San Diego\'s run-blocking shortcomings and their rival\'s sturdiness against the run, he\'s virtually unusable in shallow formats. The Broncos have surrendered just 3.3 yards per carry, 123.4 total yards per game and two scores to rushers this season equal to the seventh-fewest fantasy points allowed. Simply put: Philip Rivers is and will continue to be the star of the San Diego show, not LT. The more versatile Sproles will be the better Bolts back in Week 6.'

S'Although he\'s racked respectable, not special, numbers this season, Detroit\'s "Mall Rat" has started to receive recognition from scouts and coaches across the league. An anonymous defensive assistant told the Green Bay Gazette this week, Smith is "a guy who could get to the next level, a rising starting running back in this league." Averaging just over 12 points per game in standard leagues (No. 14 among RBs), the Lions tugboat has been one of virtual pigskin\'s best RB2s. However, with Calvin Johnson and Matthew Stafford potentially sidelined this week, the rusher will surely encounter a sea of green and yellow at the line of scrimmage. Despite their issues vertically, the Packers\' 3-4 has performed brilliantly against the run, limiting runners to a mere 3.5 yards per carry and 132.4 total yards per game. They\'ve also surrendered the sixth-fewest fantasy points to backs. Because of his featured presence in the passing game, he\'s still useful in PPR formats, but standard leaguers should seek other alternatives.'

S"Against the run, Seattle exudes a Jekyll and Hyde persona. At home, the Hawks have not conceded a touchdown to rushers, holding them to just 3.3 yards per carry and 84.3 total yards per game. However, away from Qwest Field things have transpired much differently. Right Frank Gore owners? For the PPR masses, Hightower has turned an enormous profit, averaging 6.3 receptions per contest. But, similar to last season, he's been an eyesore between the tackles netting a deplorable 3.3 yards per carry. Ken Whisenhunt noted earlier this week he wants to incorporate bruising rookie Beanie Wells more into the offensive flow, especially against Seattle. Though the tacky-handed rusher will be deployed often on passing downs, he could cede a few touches to Wells in the red zone. Couple that with the unfriendly matchup, and the Arizona RB should be net pine time in shallow, non-PPR formats."

But Cincinnati has done a masterful job containing No. 1s this season. Based on data compiled by Football Outsiders, Leon Hall and company have held foes 102.4 percent below the league average. Brandon Marshall, Greg Jennings, Santonio Holmes, Braylon Edwards and Derrick Mason have all been victimized. As Johnson's shown twice already, he isn't void of vanishing performances. Due to his incredible talents and ridiculous 10.4 targets per game average, he's impossible to demote. But a lackluster effort is certainly plausible."

S"The receiving Smith you want to own, the slick Giants wideout has been the biggest surprise sensation of the early season at WR. Currently setting the pace in points per game at his position, the former USC standout has averaged an otherworldly 9.6 targets, 7.4 receptions and 96.2 yards per contest with four touchdowns. Unquestionably Eli Manning's most reliable weapon, he's quickly become a dominating force in PPR-heavy formats. But in Eli's return to the bayou, Smith may tally his first mediocre performance of the season. Under the visionary guidance of coordinator Gregg Williams, the Saints defense has improved significantly, especially versus the pass. Picked apart aerially a season ago, New Orleans has allowed just four 70-yard games and two TDs to wideouts this year. Smith is notorious for finding creases in zone coverage and will likely do so with some success against Williams' blitz-intense schemes. However, with the Giants recommitted to the ground game and given the Saints' defensive prowess across the middle, he could notch muffled totals."

S'The Mile High Monarch finally adorned a jeweled crown last week, snagging 10 receptions for 90 yards against New England. But owners shouldn\'t immediately jump back on the bandwagon. As Josh McDaniels remarked after last week\'s emotional triumph, Royal benefited from "a lot of weak side reads." The baby-faced coach emphasized the second-year target is still a part of the rotation. In other words, he\'s still largely unreliable. Since a wounded sea lion could waddle its way to 100 yards against the Chargers frontline, Knowshon Moreno will be the focus of Denver\'s gameplan. Throw in San Diego\'s above average secondary, which ranks eighth in fewest fantasy points allowed to receivers, and Royal is destined to slide back into obscurity. Sunnier days are ahead, but this week will likely yield a gloomy result.'

S"In this year of the tight end, the towering Texan has been one of virtual pigskin's steadiest performers. Tallying an almost identical point per game output as Tony Gonzalez (8.3), Daniels have averaged 7.6 targets, 5.0 receptions and 59.2 yards per game. He's also cannonballed into the invisible pool twice. Coming off his finest yardage effort of the season (8-94 at Ari), the Wisconsin product is seemingly unbenchable. But Keith Rivers and company have performed solidly against sizable targets this season. In five clashes, no tight end has eclipsed 60 yards against them. Daniels should still yield serviceable stats in PPR formats, but for standard leaguers, Jermichael Finley (vs. Det), Brent Celek (at Oak) and Jeremy Shockey (vs. NYG) are more trustworthy options."

S'While Terrell Owens has openly complained about the Bills\' no-huddle offense, broken news about QB battles and Tweet-blasted Tony Romo off-the-field, his undemonstrative teammate, Trent Edwards, has executed near flawless football on it. Alex Van Pelt\'s balanced attack - the Bills have tallied a 56:54 pass-to-run split - has propelled the third-year QB into the upper ranks in efficiency. So far he\'s completed a laudable 64 percent of his throws, gaining 7.9 yards per attempt. Buffalo Rumblings is astonished by the offense\'s effectiveness. This week the trend should continue. Drew Brees has been unstoppable. Since the Bills have allowed 337 yards per game vertically, it\'s very likely Edwards, like Matthew Stafford and Kevin Kolb before him, will be playing catch up. The Saints have surrendered 298 passing yards per game and the eighth-most fantasy points to QBs this young season. T.O. believes Edwards still needs to improve on "assessing what he sees," but the rising star is clearly making noticeable strides. Don\'t be surprised if he eclipses the 300-yard mark for the first time in his career.'

S'Although Marion Barber is confident he will be able to contribute Monday night, deploying Jones in your virtual backfield is smart money. Prepared to transform from Tidy to Thunder Cat, the electric second-year rusher, who\'s performed admirably when provided goal-line opportunities, is primed for yeoman\'s work. Last week against the supposedly immovable Giants front seven, Jones ripped them for 96 yards on just seven touches, including a 7-yard scoring scamper. Averaging a ridiculous 9.0 yards per tote in his career, he certainly possesses plenty of home-run pop. Tamed in the trenches, the Panthers have struggled mightily containing the run. Through two weeks, they\'ve conceded 4.6 yards per carry, 145 total yards per game and three TDs to rushers, equal to the ninth-most fantasy points allowed. Due to Carolina\'s deplorable interior play, Wade Philips will challenge the underachieving defense often. Even if Barber plays, Jones\' workload will surely expand, though Tashard Choice should grip the pigskin roughly 10-12 times. Expect the former Arkansas standout to have Dallas\' fabulous cage dancers "Jingling Baby."'

S'Quietly, Hightower, who was apathetically selected in drafts, has tallied elite RB2 numbers in 12-team and deeper leagues. Currently ranked No. 13 among plowshares, he has averaged a beefy 110 total yards per game and has been an indispensable asset in PPR formats. Run-blocking is an ongoing dilemma for Arizona, but the Cards coaching staff may follow Miami\'s blueprint to mitigate Indy QB Peyton Manning. \'Zona is 12-3 under Whisenhunt when they outrush opponents. Historically vulnerable at the line of scrimmage, the Colts have been unable to remedy their trench issues. Through the first two weeks they\'ve allowed 4.8 yards per carry, 190.5 total yards per game and three TDs to rushers equal to the fifth-most fantasy points conceded. Toss in Beanie Wells\' insufferable case of fumblitis and a more balanced attack, and the forgotten Hightower may be Week 3\'s finest "Citizen on Patrol."'

S'The unabashed adoration the Noise houses for the PT Bruiser is undoubtedly disturbing. Most owners would never admit daydreaming about experiencing a "Lady and the Tramp" moment with their favorite fantasy commodity. Though this obnoxious writer\'s orange and blue bias is hard to confine, objectively speaking, Thomas is an excellent option this week, assuming previous unknown Lynell Hamilton doesn\'t get the start. The Saintly rusher logged a full practice Wednesday without any setbacks. He still wore an oversized knee brace but hopes to slip into a smaller supportive device by Sunday. Admittedly rusty against Philadelphia, PT says he feels "more comfortable this week" adding he\'s "ready to go." Hamilton has become a waiver wire sensation over the past 24 hours, but it appears the incumbent is prepared to contribute significantly. The Bills have bottled up the run with marked success this season limiting backs to just 3.0 yards per carry and 123 total yards per contest. But Brees\' ability to stretch the field and build insurmountable leads has greatly benefited Reggie Bush and Mike Bell. With Bell in street clothes and Thomas not quite 100 percent, a split backfield is likely. Still, motivated to reclaim his rightful position as the Saints\' true power back, the PT Bruiser will surely be deployed at the goal-line. He\'s a gamble play who could pay off big.'

S"Prior to his explosive exhibition against Dallas, Super Mario must have devoured a plateful of Super Mushrooms and Starmen. Catching everything in sight, the second-year wideout was invincible snagging 10 passes for 150 yards, including an acrobatic 22-yard TD reception. Tutored by former Jags standout Keenan McCardell this past summer, the former Wolverine learned how to use his quickness to deceive and bewilder defenders. Despite a minor shoulder injury, fantasy's current top WR scorer should continue his riveting start against a tattered and torn Tampa secondary. Losing starting safety Jermaine Phillips to a broken thumb last week, the Bucs' aerial containers are even more susceptible than they were a week ago. So far this season, they've yielded the most scores to WRs (5) and eight 20-yard pass plays, the second-most in the NFL. Averaging a very healthy 8.5 targets per contest, Super Mario will once again drive pixilated princesses and owners lovingly wild."

S"Sir Drops-A-Lot may not be trustworthy holding small, fragile children, but despite his continuous botches, he should be the object of dependability this week against Baltimore. Shockingly, as good as the Ravens have performed in the trenches they've been equally porous through the air. No secondary has allowed more 20-yard pass plays than the Black Birds. They've also yielded the eighth-most fantasy points to wideouts. Due to chemistry problems and perpetual suckage, Edwards and Brady Quinn are the antithesis of Montana-to-Rice. But based on Baltimore's troubles handcuffing receivers deep and the expected large hole the Browns will likely dig, Banana Hands is an upside WR2. Don't be swayed by the presumed difficult matchup."

S"Sims-Walker hopes to enter the pantheon of hyphenated greats where the marble likenesses of teammate Maurice Jones-Drew and former Floridian standout Karim Abdul-Jabbar (now Abdul-Karim al-Jabbar) are on display. One of Week 2's hottest waiver wire acquisitions, the lengthy target snatched a career best-tying six receptions for 106 yards and a TD last week versus Arizona. Because the Jags' defense is horrendous and Troy Williamson is sidelined for the remainder of the season, the 6-foot-2, 209-pound wideout should receive considerable looks in Houston. Unless the Texans suddenly turn back the clock to Week 1, they should have little difficulty building a sizable early lead. In only his second game ever as a starter, Sims-Walker should pay a nice dividend."

S'With Higgins (Kevin Kolb) manning the controls, the Magnum P.I. of fantasy tight ends has become must start material overnight. A popular late-round staple on pundit sleeper lists, Celek was targeted a career-high 11 times Week 2 against \'Nawlins, grabbing eight passes for 104 yards. Through two games he\'s tallied an eye-catching 18 targets, one shy of league pacesetter Kellen Winslow. As my colleague Jason Cole remarked last week on "Fantasy Football Live," the bond forged between Kolb and Celek is very Romo/Witten-like. Matched against an uninspiring Kansas City defense this week, the Eagles monolith is poised to again fly high. A line similar to Todd Heap\'s Week 1 against the Chiefs is certainly attainable. Remember, fantasy Nostradomus Chris Cooley, who mind you sells hateful Eagles t-shirts on his website, was high on Celek preseason.'

S'In the early season, Flacco has flourished. Currently the third-best QB in Fantasyland, the second-year slinger has averaged 248.5 yards per game and posted an exceptional 5:2 TD:INT split. Though he has made tremendous strides in blitz recognition, accuracy and overall performance, the Baltimore QB is undependable this week against Cleveland. Eric Mangini is well aware the Ravens\' punishing ground game "can hurt you," especially given the frontline deficiencies his defense has displayed. It\'s because of the Chihuahuas\' shortcomings against the run Cam Cameron will likely institute a more conservative approach this week - Minnesota and Denver did so with much success - limiting Flacco\'s scoring potential. Because everyone is pounding them into submission, the Browns have surrendered just 186.5 passing yards per game. The opponent looks delectable, but don\'t bite.'

S"The popular first-round pick has lived a Jekyll and Hyde existence through the first two weeks. Week 1 in Arizona Gore's two scores masked his abominable 48 total yards and 1.4 yards per carry average. Meanwhile last week, he drowned the Hawks in Puget Sound ripping off 246 total yards and two long touchdowns. This week, expect more of the former rather than the latter. Though the Vikings have looked more pliable than in years past, Jared Allen and company have surrendered just 3.8 yards per carry to rushers this season. More damning for Gore owners, no rusher has reached triple-digits against them in 25 consecutive games. The outspoken Allen blames Minnesota's shortcomings on sloppy tackling, but with a renewed emphasis on fundamentals this week in practice, the Purple-headed warriors are hungry to regain their label as the NFC's premiere people eater defense. A season ago, Gore failed to eclipse 10 fantasy points in a game just four times. Week 3 will be the first time he fails to surpass double-digits in '09."

S"Captain Quick played the role of judge, jury and executioner Week 2 in Houston. Likely establishing a new one-week benchmark in your league's record book, the fleet-footed back compiled an obscene 284 total yards and three touchdowns. His ludicrous 12.3 yards per carry clip is a mark Larry Johnson (2.8 ypc) couldn't achieve dressed in a suit of armor while riding on the back of an enraged rhinoceros. It may seem absurd to designate Johnson a lame after such a remarkable performance, but Rex Ryan's Gang Green D is hell-bent on stopping the Titans rushing attack. Hinting they would be more aggressive than usual, Ryan is expected to hurl a flurry of confusing run blitzes, stunts and twists at Tennessee in an attempt to force Kerry Collins airborne. On the ground, New York has conceded a mere 3.6 yards per carry and 94.5 total yards per game to rushers equal to the second-fewest fantasy points. Johnson obviously could take one to the house in a nanosecond, but when challenged by a supposed intimidating foe (i.e. Tom Brady) the Jets have risen to the occasion."

S"Last year's first-round pick has shown flashes of his vibrant future over the first two weeks, but has largely been lackluster averaging just 3.6 yards per carry. Denver's 3-4 defense, a disheveled, laughable unit a year ago, has miraculously morphed into a commendable force, especially against the run. The Broncos have allowed just 2.9 yards per carry and 105 total yards per game to opposing plowshares equal to the 10th-fewest fantasy points yielded. The season-ending injury to hole creator Robert Gallery only complicates matters. Without his services, Elvis Dumervil and his fellow trench soldiers will likely penetrate the backfield with ease. Tom Cable is worried. Because McFadden doesn't possesses tackle-shredding power, significant gains will be hard to come by. He's supremely talented, but without even an average passing attack and Gallery, the Oakland rusher will be confined."

S'To the opinionated Housh, Bears GM Jerry Angelo and Madden gaming engineers are one in the same. Motivated by Chicago\'s disinterest in signing him this past offseason, Seattle\'s top wideout is ready to prove Angelo made a terrible mistake. Confident he will get open "no matter who it is," the multi-time Pro Bowl selection may eat his own words. Most experts painted the Bears secondary as a bleak unit entering the season, but Peanut Tillman and his cohorts have actually exceeded expectation. Against Green Bay and Pittsburgh, only one receiver found pay-dirt and just two eclipsed 80-yards against them. Housh has been featured prominently (9 tgt/g) but has yet to contribute noticeably on the virtual gridiron (Ranked 50th among WRs). If Matt Hasselbeck, who is expected to be a game-time decision, is declared inactive, Houshmandzadeh\'s chances of a productive day decrease dramatically. It\'s hard to justify sitting the veteran in PPR formats, but Manningham (at TB), Steve Smith (NYG) (at TB), Jerricho Cotchery (vs. Ten) and the now healthy Kevin Walter (vs. Jac) are more favorable options.'

S'Brandon Funston\'s personal "Glass Joe" has had a rollercoaster start to \xe2\x80\x9809. After notching a dazzling line Week 1 in Tampa, the greasy-handed wideout performed poorly against a banged-up Giants secondary, failing to surpass 20 yards receiving. His stellar 36.3 catch percentage verifies the receiver\'s mild frustration with Tony Romo. Clearly, the chemistry between the two is still a work in progress. Against the G-Men, Williams was forced to transform into, as he put it, "Flozell Adams," creating running lanes downfield for Felix Jones and Marion Barber. A similar role could be on the docket Week 3 versus Carolina. As discussed earlier, the Panthers have been gashed on the ground this year, surrendering 4.6 yards per carry to rushers. However, through the air, Chris Gamble and Richard Marshall have defended excellently. No wide receiver has exceeded 60 yards against the duo this year. Unless Williams dips his gloves in honey, he won\'t be the first.'

S"Though Keith Rivers has downplayed the now illegal blindsided block Ward levied on him a season ago, it will surely motivate the linebacker and his teammates to humiliate the aggressive wideout this week. The 33-year-old has, as usual, been an asset in PPR-intensive formats, catching 14 balls for 160 yards. But similar to last season, touchdowns are once again a luxury. Cincinnati's revamped defense has performed commendably so far this season, especially against possession receivers (i.e. Eddie Royal and Greg Jennings). The veteran totaled one touchdown and averaged a vanilla 2.5 receptions and 48.5 yards per game against the Bengals in '08. With Rivers internally hungry to exact revenge, Ward may accumulate mediocre totals."

S"Shiancoe, a preseason All-Mancrush Team candidate, hasn't yet lived up to the Noise's overzealous prognostication. After two weeks of action, his 8.7 points per game mark ranks 23rd among tight ends. This week, against a 49ers defense anchored by suffocating linebacker Patrick Willis, the towering target is unreliable. In their last game, the Gold Panners handcuffed Seattle's John Carlson, limiting him to six catches for 46 yards. Based on Shiancoe's stratospheric size, he's always a threat in the red zone, but San Fran has allowed just four TE touchdowns over its past 18 games. Jermichael Finley (at StL), Kevin Boss (at TB) and Tony Scheffler (at Oak) are better options."

S'In Monday Night\'s ratings bonanza, the almost 40-year-old Favre defied Father Time, turning back the clock to his vintage, rifling days. Against one of the NFC\'s stiffest secondaries, Green Bay, he tossed 271 yards for three touchdowns. More importantly, he completed a ridiculous 77.4 percent of his attempts, a dramatic improvement from the week before (52.2 percent). The rancid Rams have ramped up their play against the run, but at a vertical cost. Though they\'ve limited rushers to just 3.9 yards per carry, passers have averaged a healthy 235.5 yards per game and totaled seven touchdowns against them equal to the seventh-most fantasy points surrendered. Additional game-manager performances are on the horizon, but with his arm "feeling great" and given the Rams\' inability to get to the quarterback effectively, the graybeard will once again showcase a youthful exuberance.'

S"Overshadowed by Braylon Edwards' Tom Cable impersonation and subsequent exodus to New York, Harrison has quietly performed fantastically over the past two weeks, especially in PPR formats. Defying critics' undersized contentions, the versatile rusher has totaled 118.5 total yards per game as a starter, including his first 100-yard effort of his career against a rigid Bengals defense. Sideline-to-sideline, as Eric Mangini observed last week, the Browns' offensive line/receivers have blocked well, creating space for Harrison to shuttle through. Shifty and quick, the light-footed rusher is another strong play against banged up Buffalo, a team his only career TD came against. The Bills have yielded 4.9 yards per carry, 180.3 total yards per game and eight total scores to RBs this season equal to the third-most fantasy points allowed. Derek Anderson's ability to effectively stretch the field combined with the improved play of the barkers up front means Harrison is def-in-itely in the HOWSE. Raise a forty to the sky fool!"

The McDevil has clung to an "unplanned formula" at RB, routinely rotating rushers. But based on the rookie\'s increased workload over the past two weeks, he is clearly the primary carrier. Since Week 3, Moreno has touched the pill 18.7 times per contest, averaging 4.4 yards per carry and 87.7 total yards per game. The Patriots defense, which has underperformed due to a bevy of injuries, especially in the linebacker corps, has been vulnerable on the ground. Rushers have averaged an impressive 4.5 yards per carry and 138.3 total yards per game against Beelzechick\'s bunch. In the Clash of the Satans, look for Knowshon to provide all the answers.'

S"Mancrushin' on McCoy has been a common exercise for the Noise. The rookie, who has exhibited outstanding versatility, burst, cut-back ability and vision, is quickly wresting away touches from brittle Brian Westbrook. Although the veteran is back close to full strength and is expected to start, the Eagles, as Andy Reid emphatically said before the bye week, plan to institute a timeshare, possibly giving McCoy at least 40 percent of the touches. The youngster, a junior clone of Westbrook, should inflict substantial damage on a Tampa defense with roughly 12-15 touches. Skewered by the run this season, the Bucs have surrendered 4.8 yards per carry, 164.8 total yards per game and two scores to backs. For PT Cruiser, LT and Forte owners dealing with the bye week blues, McCoy will likely be the ultimate pick-me-up."

S'Mason may have played rockball with triceratopses in the Jurassic, but he still remains one of fantasy\'s most dependable consistency kings. The seemingly ancient veteran, an incredibly savvy route runner and playmaker who coach John Harbaugh calls "the best he\'s seen" during his time in the league, ranks in the top 30 all-time in receptions and yards. This week, he will undoubtedly add to his fringe Hall of Fame totals. Leon Hall, who many pundits have showered in admiration, was abused last week by, of all people, Mohamed Massaquoi. Outside of last week\'s awful effort, Hall has performed commendably this season, unlike his fellow DBs. The Bengals have allowed the most 20-yard pass plays and the 10th-most fantasy points to wideouts this season. Due to their obvious shortcomings in downfield coverage, Joe Flacco will surely take advantage, targeting Mason often. Averaging a very healthy 8.3 looks per game, the 35-year-old receiver is destined to finish in the WR top 20 for the second straight week.'

S'For much of the season, the Cowboys aerial attack has reeked of manure. Plagued by drops (Roy Williams needs a hands transplant) and general inconsistency, standout efforts have been few and far between. Since setting career highs in yards Week 1 (135 at TB), Crayton has sloughed off failing to eclipse the 50-yard mark in three consecutive contests. But with Williams a game-time decision (ribs), the former seventh-round pick is poised to see a rise in targets. The Chiefs are a battered and bruised unit defensively. Over the first four weeks, they\'ve allowed the sixth-most fantasy points to wideouts. Though Crayton has clamored for the coaching staff to lean more on the "five freaks of nature" upfront, increasing reps for Marion Barber and Tashard Choice, the passing game will be stressed. Tony Romo desperately needs to establish cadence with his receivers. Employ his services as a WR3 in all formats.'

A product of Division III powerhouse Mount Union, the second-year wideout, who Colts president Bill Polian believes is the second-coming of Andre Reed, is a fierce YAC monster with superb speed. Gaining the confidence of Peyton Manning each week, he currently ranks 22nd among wideouts in points per game averaging 51.8 yards per contest with two scores. Though inflexible up front, the Titans have been an abomination vertically. Carved up repeatedly by opposing passing attacks, they've yielded an obscene seven scores and five 90-plus yard receivers, the most in the league. Considering the Colts run game is still in development, Manning will go airborne early and often - great news for Garcon. Based on the matchup and expected gameplan, the fleet-footed receiver easily could establish new single-game benchmarks in receptions and yards."

Jim Mora believes the former Golden Domer "has a chance to be something really special." This week against an exploitable Jacksonville defense, he could exhibit those extraordinary talents. The Jags played laudably against Dallas Clark and Owen Daniels earlier this season, limiting the pair under 40 yards each. But Carlson, the third-most targeted TE in the league (8.0 tgt/g), will be leaned upon with TJ Houshmandzadeh and Nate Burleson drawing away coverage. In a contest which could become a shootout look for the second-year standout to post his first respectable effort in three weeks.'

Brady, who ranks No. 12 in points per game among QBs, has been largely mediocre totaling just five touchdowns (four pass, one rush) in four games. Hindered by the absence of Wes Welker and the balky back of Randy Moss, the Pats passer, along with the New England offense as a whole, has struggled to find a "consistent level of play on a game-to-game and play-to-play basis." Under Mike Nolan\'s masterful direction, the My Little Ponies have transformed into world-class thoroughbreds defensively, especially against the pass. The Broncos have yet to concede a passing touchdown and have limited QBs to just 181 yards per game equal to the fewest fantasy points allowed. Brady is a daunting assignment, but Denver may very well rise to the occasion yet again.'

Center Todd McClure admitted earlier this week Atlanta is "falling short in the run game," blaming "small breakdowns here and there" on the lack of sizable gains. More of the same could be in order in the Golden Gate City. Emulating their hardnosed coach, Mike Singletary, the Niners have hogtied backs this season, holding them to just 3.5 yards per carry, zero scores and 72 rushing yards per game, including punishers Adrian Peterson (85 ryds) and Steven Jackson (79). It\'s extremely difficult to demote such a marquee name, but Aubrayo Franklin and company are more than capable of dominating the line of scrimmage.'

S"As we discussed two weeks ago, the McGahee makeover has been remarkable. Transforming into the Optimus Prime of goal-line poachers, the reinvigorated back has crossed the chalk a league-high seven times in four games, which has propelled his per game average into the RB top-five. Based on the Ravens' stellar trench play, it may seem like the veteran will splash pay-dirt every week, but against Cincy, the streak will cease. Tank Johnson, who is usually heavily-armed before, during and after games, and his cohorts have played laudably upfront. Through four weeks, they've allowed just 3.9 yards per carry, one rushing TD and 115 total yards per game to rushers equal to the ninth-fewest fantasy points surrendered. Joe Flacco should have marked success vertically, which could set up McGahee for a few red-zone carries, but we're gambling on a scoreless afternoon."

S"The Slasher finally showcased his sharpened wares last week totaling 89 yards with two touchdowns against the repugnant Raiders. However, in the desert, he's destined to sink in quicksand. At home the Cardinals have been an intimidating defensive foe for visiting rushers. Stretching back to last season, they've yielded just 3.7 yards per carry and 89.1 rushing yards per contest to backs. Despite last week's impressive showing, Gary Kubiak is still concerned with the Texans ground game, remarking his two-man scheme should be able to successfully penetrate eight-man fronts. Slaton's well-roundedness may give \xe2\x80\x98Zona occasional fits, but another underwhelming effort might be in the cards. So far this season, Arizona has conceded a mere 2.9 yards per carry to rushers."

S'America needs a T.O. tirade. Though his matchup against the Chihuahuas appears delectable, Buffalo\'s general ineptitude offensively is very disconcerting. Trent Edwards pins the Bills\' recent struggles on well-disguised "third-down pressure." The Browns have conceded the ninth-most fantasy points to pass catchers this season, but with Owens netting a lowly five targets per game, he\'s very undependable. Given Cleveland\'s softness between the hashmarks, Skeletor (Dick Jauron) will likely rely heavily on Fred Jackson and Marshawn Lynch to reestablish a rhythm offensively and alleviate pocket pressure. Even though the matchup seems favorable, don\'t be surprised if the Twitter fiend fails to deliver once again.'

S"Practically dormant over the first two weeks of the season, Moss emerged from hibernation catching 12 passes for 252 yards and two scores against exploitable Detroit and Tampa. Though Carolina has underperformed defensively in the trenches, the Panthers have been just the opposite aerially. In three games they've yet to allow a receiver surpass 80 yards and have surrendered only one score equal to the fourth-fewest fantasy points conceded to WRs. When targeted underneath, Moss is very slippery, but when jammed (i.e. versus the Giants Week 1) he can vanish. In what will likely be a low scoring affair, the red-hot Washington wideout will be extinguished."

S"Subtract Super Mario's spectacular game against Dallas and he's essentially been a pixilated plumber without a wrench averaging just 55.3 yards per game. Matched against an Oakland defense which thrives against the pass and, conversely, gets pounded on the ground, the Giants will undoubtedly lean on the Frankensteins (Brandon Jacobs and Ahmad Bradshaw) with or without Eli Manning. According to Football Outsiders, No. 2 targets have performed 28.1 percent below the league average against the Silver and Black. Couple that with the expectation New York will aggressively attack Nnamdi Asomugha; and Manningham's chances of snapping his mini-funk decrease significantly. Any suitable pass catching Viking (i.e. Sidney Rice, Bernard Berrian or Percy Harvin) is more reliable this week."

Though a similar outcome could occur, we're bearish on the monolithic target again. The Gold Panners have handcuffed opposing TEs this season. In four games, they've have averaged a deplorable 2.8 receptions and 25.5 yards per game against them. None have scored. Simply put: Patrick Willis typically strangles his assignments. Gonzo is without question one of Matt Ryan's most trusted targets, but this week Roddy White and Michael Jenkins may be the points of emphasis vertically for the Dirty Birds."

S'Barrages of poison-tipped darts have been blown at Cutler by the local and national media over the past few days. In their eyes, the Chicago fire of 1871 was less of a disaster. Everyone has donned their Freudian hats in an attempt to explain the quarterback\'s ungraceful, Grossmanesque downfall. Some have idiotically gone as far as calling him an "average player." The overthrows and misreads are entirely on No. 6 \xe2\x80\x93 mechanically he is certainly flawed \xe2\x80\x93 but without a suitable stable of receivers and even average offensive line, failure is hard to dodge. Many would say his matchup with Minnesota is less than desirable. Jared Allen and his QB harassing cohorts should have a field day. But the Vikings are susceptible to the pass. On the season they\'ve allowed 258.3 passing yards and 1.4 touchdowns per contest to signal callers. More importantly, the Norsemen have picked off just one pass since Week 5. Cutler will be pestered. The running game will undoubtedly struggle. The Bears, who defensively are a mess, will likely be playing from behind. If the admonished passer can establish an early cadence and find Matt Forte in the flat, the cooker will depressurize, at least temporarily.'

S'Two weeks ago RB-hungry owners combed their league\'s waiver wire in a frantic attempt to acquire the converted fullback. Only a select few emerged from the fray with back on roster. The winners should consider themselves lucky. Snelling, fantasy\'s equivalent of the Zhu Zhu hamster, is a rusher in demand. With Michael Turner likely out again this week and possibly beyond and Jerious Norwood also a gigantic question mark, the between-the-tackles grinder is destined to mash Tampa\'s group of defensive Mr. Potatoheads. Since Week 7, the Bucs have surrendered 5.1 yards per carry, 166 total yards per game and five scores to rushers, equal to the ninth-most fantasy points allowed. With the Falcons likely to establish scoreboard supremacy early, Snelling could gain appreciable points salting away the clock in the second half. His second straight multi-TD seems like a certainty. (UPDATE: Michael Turner practiced again on Thursday, though on a "limited" basis. He is slated to be a full-blown game-time decision Sunday. If The Burner is active, Snelling obviously is not a flame recommendation.)'

S"Regardless of Julius Jones' situation, Forsett is USDA certified Grade-A flame. Collectively, Hawks rushers have averaged 3.7 yards per carry and the fewest total yards in the league. Prior to Forsett's rise to prominence, Jim Mora sporadically tried to feed the rushing attack. Only success against flaccid opponents was achieved. But the former Cal standout has jumpstarted the ground game. Though he rushed for only nine yards on an equal number of carries last week in Minnesota, the undersized runner \xe2\x80\x93 the latest height-challenged back to reap success \xe2\x80\x93 has averaged 119 total yards per game and totaled two scores in his past two games. Decisive, quick and powerful according to Mora, he is a terrific multidimensional weapon. Those skills should cause chaos in St. Louis. The Rams have performed poorly against the run for much of the season, especially of late. Since Week 7, they've yielded 5.5 yards per carry, 191.8 total yards per game and five scores to backs, equal to the third-most fantasy points allowed. Jones will start if healthy, but even if he suits up, Forsett should net at least 12-15 touches. (minus Jones)"

S'With Brian Westbrook in a daze, the Noise has danced romantically with the rookie\'s Fathead likeness over the past couple weeks. Our song: Spandu Ballet\'s "True." The Eagles staff finally pulled its heads-from-posterior last week against the Bears, running McCoy 20 times. Despite what could\'ve been a costly late-game fumble, he totaled 99 yards and a touchdown. In three starts this season, the multi-tooled back has averaged 82.3 total yards per game and splashed pay-dirt twice. Similar numbers lie ahead against division rival Washington, which could again be without premier run stopper Albert Haynesworth. Even with the hole-plunger active, the \'Skins have struggled containing the run. Since Week 7, they\'ve conceded 5.4 yards per carry to RBs. Assuming Marty Mornhinweg continues to strive for balance and the Eagles\' front can sustain its blocks, McCoy should again be a very useful RB2 in 12-team formats.'

S'Revenge could taste very sweet for the former Charger. Kicked to the curb by San Diego earlier this season, the veteran has regained his long-distance form in KC. Since joining the Chiefs he\'s scored twice and averaged 83 yards per game. Over the past five weeks, only three receivers have surpassed the 70-yard mark against the Bolts. But Chambers\' familiarity with the secondary and motivation to prove his previous employer wrong are factors which can\'t be ignored. After last week\'s stunning upset of Pittsburgh, the wideout sincerely believes Todd Haley\'s offensive is finally "progressing." No longer burdened by Larry Johnson\'s black cloud and with Matt Cassel\'s time in the pocket increasing, Chambers\' observations aren\'t farfetched. Another competitive performance is in order.'

S"Inconsistency has occasionally plagued the former Mount Union star, but over the past few weeks he has really discovered a groove. As Stampede Blue noted earlier this week, Garcon is growing up right before people's eyes. His first career 100-yard effort last week in Baltimore is proof. With Austin Collie taking a backseat and more defenses forced to rotate help to Reggie Wayne's side, the second-year wideout has drawn increased looks from Peyton Manning. Since Week 7 he's averaged 8.6 targets and 59 yards per game. Houston has yielded the fewest fantasy points to receivers during that same span, but with matchups against vertically challenged Buffalo and Tennessee that ranking is deceiving. Garcon snapped five catches for 60 yards in their first meeting. Expect him to pay a higher dividend against a Houston secondary minus starting safety Eugene Wilson."

S"The third time will be the charm for Crabtree. Failing to march into flame territory in his previous two appearances on this list, the sticky-fingered rookie should easily surpass the seven-point threshold this time around. Corner Tyron Brackenridge, filling in for injured former All-Pro Rashean Mathis, was humilated last week by Terrell Owens. Though Crabtree doesn't possess the experience of T.O., his slick route-running and size will wreak havoc. The Jags have allowed the fifth-most fantasy points to receivers since Week 7, surrendering a pair of fives in touchdowns and 70-yard performances. San Francisco has produced unsteady yields in the passing game for much of the season. But Alex Smith's comfort level and success operating out of the spread has forced Mike Singletary and Jimmy Raye to reinvent the wheel. The former Red Raider, a huge proponent of the system, is certainly pushing the staff to stretch personnel packages horizontally. Assuming the handcuffs are again taken off Smith, Crabtree should be an elite No. 3 in Week 12."

S'Forget turkey. Finley instead plans to feast on a holiday delicacy - Lion. After missing several games with a sprained knee, the talented tight end is finally 100 percen and producing. Last week against San Fran, he attracted 10 targets catching seven passes for 54 yards. Interestingly, he operated almost exclusively out of the slot in an attempt to draw one-on-one coverage. If Mike McCarthy follows a similar blueprint, Finley will carve up the Hello Kitties. His size and athleticism is a matchup nightmare. On the year, the Lions have allowed nine touchdowns to oversized targets, the most in the league. Look for that number to increase in Week 12. For frustrated Jason Witten owners fed up with his underperformance or worried about his availability on Thanksgiving, Finley could be just what the doctor ordered.'

S"Viewers could've consumed the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy during the time it took McNabb to exchange pumpkin pie recipes with Cutler after last Sunday night's game. After this week, he may need to seek the advice Ron Jaworski. Many pundits have mistakenly categorized the Redskins' No. 1 pass defense ranking as misleading. With St. Louis, Detroit, Tampa, Carolina and KC on its resume, Washington has indeed faced its fair share of cupcakes. But even against respectable passing offenses (i.e. last week at Dallas) the 'Skins secondary has performed admirably. On the year, only two passers, Matthew Stafford and Eli Manning, have eclipsed the 200-yard mark against them and only one, Kyle Orton in Week 10, has thrown for multiple scores. McNabb was limited to just 156 yards and a score in their first meeting, largely due to an early Philly lead. But this is a defense playing with marked confidence. Consider safer alternatives (i.e. Brett Favre vs. Chi, Carson Palmer vs. Cle or Matt Ryan vs. TB)."

S"For one week only, the Noise's love affair with Mendenhall hits the skids. Despite averaging a ridiculous 5.2 yards per carry since Week 7, Bruce Arians' insistence on passing inside the 10 has made the former Illinois standout wildly inconsistent in recent weeks. Case in point, after running effectively for much of the game in last week's slip up at KC, he touched the rock just one time over the final 4:54. Maddening. Another unbalanced pass-to-run ratio should be expected this week in Baltimore. The Ravens have regained their defensive mojo over the past several weeks, especially up front. Over their past five games they've held rushers to just 3.4 yards per carry and 99 total yards per game. Ben Roethlisberger is expected to take snaps after passing post-concussion tests with flying colors, but in a critical contest for both teams, Ray Lewis earns the check. Remember the last time Mendenhall ventured into Ravens territory he left with his arm in a sling."

S"The No. 1 item on Maroney's wish list this holiday shopping season: anything Voltron. Last week, the goofy rusher told the Boston Globe the Patriots backfield was coming together like the motorized elements that comprised the 80s cartoon icon. Unfortunately, that negatively affects the back's fantasy value. With Sammy Morris slated to return Monday and Kevin Faulk's 7-10 touch role solidified, Maroney's per carries average is sure to diminish. Even if he were to net 15-20 totes in Monday's mammoth bayou battle, he isn't a recommended start. Sedrick Ellis' return to the lineup greatly enhances a Saints defense which has been pounded by the run. When healthy during the first seven weeks of the season, Ellis helped limit rushers to just 3.9 yards per carry and 80.5 rushing yards per game. Simply put: the D-lineman is a man-eating game changer. In what we'll surely be a fireworks show, Maroney will fade into the background."

S"Likely minus Matthew Stafford and Calvin Johnson, Smith will be the focus of the Packers' defensive gameplan. The flexible rusher was an absolute beast last week totaling 149 yards (104 receiving) and a score on just 16 touches. But compared to Green Bay, Cleveland is a group of yappy pink poodles. Dom Capers' 3-4 defense has typically applied little pressure on the pocket, instead dropping defenders back in coverage or attacking gaps on running plays. The results against the run have been spectacular. RBs have averaged just 3.6 yards per carry against the Pack. Green Bay has also surrendered the third-fewest fantasy points to rushers this season. Smith totaled just 61 yards on 15 carries against his NFC North nemesis Week 6. A similar letdown is in order."

S"Receivers matched against Jets have routinely been featured in this space. No player is immune to catching the Darelle Disease. Just ask Andre Johnson, Randy Moss and Marques Colston. Smith will be the latest victim. Unlike the aforementioned Pro Bowlers, the slippery wideout doesn't have a complementary option to keep defenses honest. Mushin Muhammad has actually turned into Bullwinkle. Clearly the focus of Carolina's offense is to wear down opponents between-the-hashmarks with DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart. New York has improved against the run in recent weeks surrendering just 4.0 yards per carry to rushers since Week 7, but stopping rushers is still the Jets' primary weakness. With Revis draped all over him, Smith will be nothing more than a decoy."

S"Fame and fortune has come at a heavy cost for Austin. After accumulating galactic numbers from Weeks 5-8, the downward-trending wideout has totaled just nine catches for 116 yards and a score in his past three contests. Defenses have rotated coverage over to his side, which explains why his banner production has quickly ceased. Great receivers early in their careers have garnered similar attention. Once Austin makes the necessary adjustments, he'll recapture the magic. But don't expect it to happen this week. Though the Raiders have allowed the 11th-most 20-yard pass plays this season, Nnamdi Asomugha will likely blanket the young wideout, stymieing his scoring potential. In an attempt to gain breathing room, Jason Garrett will creatively shift Austin around, which could free him downfield. Still, only six receivers have reached the 70-yard mark against Oakland this year. Don't let Austin ruin your turkey."

Despite being outshined consistently by ageless teammate Hines Ward and occasionally Mike Wallace, owners still confidently insert Holmes into their lineups every week. Stunning. Though he's averaged a robust 81.5 yards per game over his past five games, he hasn't crossed the chalk since Week 1. Against the reinvigorated Ravens, that streak will continue. They've allowed the third-fewest fantasy points to receivers since Week 7. Baltimore is a team which relishes eliminating the strengths of the opposition. Look at what it accomplished last week against the Colts (91 total yards for Wayne and Dallas Clark). This week, they ground Pittsburgh's aerial show."

During that stretch he's caught just eight passes for 85 yards. He's also only scored one touchdown since Week 1. The Patriots have done a masterful job muffling tight ends this season, surrendering the eighth-fewest fantasy points. And it's not like they've faced suspect competition. Position cornerstones Tony Gonzalez, Kellen Winslow and Dallas Clark totaled just 90 yards against them. Shockey gets stuffed."

S'Over the past several weeks Campbell has undergone an identity reconstruction. Sherm Lewis\' implementation of short-step drops and timing routes has accelerated the QB\'s level of play. The signal caller admits the game has "really slowed down" since Lewis seized the play-calling reigns from Jim Zorn. The numbers support his feelings. Over the past five weeks, he\'s averaged 253.9 yards per game and totaled eight scores \xe2\x80\x93 good for the 11th-best per game output at his position. Success, however, is the sum of all parts. Protection up front and a revitalized ground game have helped minimize pocket chaos. The Giants, led by party crasher Justin Tuck, are an aggressive defensive unit which relishes rattling quarterbacks. However, if Campbell is given enough time, he should pick apart a G-Men secondary ravaged by injuries. Since Week 9, New York has surrendered 303 yards per game and eight scores to passers, equal to the third-most fantasy points. A top-10 effort seems likely.'

S"The former Buckeye's matchup with the loathsome Lions in the Motor City will certainly evoke memories of his college arch-nemesis. If he imagines the Lions are colored maize and blue, a banner effort will certainly be achieved. You don't want to make Beanie angry. Despite coughing up the ball in a critical moment in last week's Grease Bowl versus San Francisco, Wells appears to have surpassed Tim Hightower in the rushing pecking order. He showed tremendous burst and humiliating power running for 79 yards on 15 carries (5.3 ypc). Detroit has actually performed respectably against soft run-blocking offenses (i.e. Green Bay), but, as Ray Rice proved a week ago, this is still an exploitable unit. Over the past five weeks the Hello Kitties have allowed 4.7 yards per carry, 189.4 total yards per game and six scores to rushers, equal to the third-most fantasy points. Because of Detroit's issues defending the pass, Kurt Warner will likely go ballistic, but Ken Whisenhunt and Russ Grimm are committed to establishing offensive balance. Wells will get plenty of work. Label him a strong RB2 in Week 15."

Because Julius Jones would have difficulty eluding a sea monkey, it only made sense the more effective rusher would be provided additional opportunities. Unfortunately, in-game circumstances crippled Forsett's chances of resurgence last week. Still, he totaled a noteworthy 73 yards on just 13 touches. This week against the woeful Bucs his workload should expand. Tampa has conceded 4.9 yards per carry, 163 total yards per game and seven TDs to runners since Week 9, equal to the fifth-most fantasy points. Seattle's offense has remained in neutral for much of the season, but this week at home, the Hawks should shift gears. Based on Tampa's trench issues, expect the versatile dynamo to puncture the RB top 20 with ease."

S'The bane of Ray Rice owners\' existence is once again twisting the dagger. Part of Baltimore\'s renewed three-headed hydra, McGahee has reclaimed his role as goal-line sniffer scoring four times in his past five contests. Cam Cameron and John Harbaugh, obvious supporters of Obama\'s green agenda, have stressed the need to be an "all-weather offense." They feel running the ball in chilly conditions will be the key to landing a spot in the second season. Though the outcome of last week\'s matchup against the Lions was determined early, the trio of backs saw significant action. McGahee compiled 78 yards and two scores on 13 touches. Against Chicago, the TD poacher\'s workload will likely be smaller, but even with limited touches he should produce an appreciable yield. Over the past five weeks, the Paddington Bears have allowed 4.5 yards per carry 153.2 total yards per game and six scores to backs, equal to the 10th-most fantasy points. Jay Cutler\'s proneness to self-destruction combined with the Ravens\' exceptional run-blocking suggest McGahee could again tally terrific flex totals in 12-team and deeper formats.'

S'The serial name-dropper, who commented two weeks ago he wants a similar workload as "good pal" Andre Johnson, may have a future roster spot on the Los Angeles Arnolds (Get to the choppa!!!). Humility apparently isn\'t one of Bryant\'s finer qualities, but he has a point. Clearly the most talented wideout on roster, last season\'s playoff hero has netted just 6.8 targets per game since his return. This week in Seattle, double-digit looks are a strong possibility. Marcus Trufant played with his pants down in last week\'s blowout loss to Houston. Bryant\'s home-skillet, Johnson, exploded for 11 catches, 193 yards and two scores, his highest fantasy output of the season. Due to Josh Freeman\'s turnover magnetism, the Hawks will certainly follow an aggressive blueprint. But if the Bucs\' hogs up front can protect the rookie adequately, he should connect with Bryant early and often. Since Week 9, no defense has been more generous to receivers than Seattle. Over that stretch, the flightless birds have surrendered 10 touchdowns and six 70-yard WR performances. Expect Bryant to post his best effort of the season.'

S"Despite being severely limited by a calf injury in practice last week, the Hyphenated Great cowboyed up. Unfortunately, those who employed his services were gifted a holed-out pastry. At least the sprinkles were tasty. Healthier entering action this week, Sims-Walker should be trusted against a Colts team simply going through the motions. With playoff hopes on the line, the Jags must play their best game of the season. Another home loss would be crippling. Indy's young secondary was manhandled by MSW's former Central Florida teammate Brandon Marshall a week ago, surrendering an NFL-record 21 catches. Because of the young wideout's size and athleticism another Golden Knight should skewer Indy's banged up secondary. The unblemished Colts have allowed the fourth-most fantasy points to wideouts since Week 9. Have faith."

S"For those diversifying their portfolios, investing in Evans Enterprises is a savvy move. The profitable wideout has earned a staggering $291,105 per catch this season. Cha-chump! Terrell Owens' resurrection has turned the speedster into a one-catch pony in recent weeks. Since Week 11 he's failed to cannonball into the invisible pool and snagged just five passes for 104 yards. Despite his disappearing act, Evans is someone worth trusting this week. Saying New England has struggled in pass coverage is a gross understatement. The Pats made Matt Moore look semi-competent last week. Since Week 9, they've yielded 10 touchdowns and six 80-yard performances to pass catchers, equal to the second-most fantasy points. Due to New England's coverage shortcomings, Perry Fewell will likely install an aggressive vertical gameplan. Based on the strides Ryan Fitzpatrick has made over the second half, it's possible Evans could finally break a long one or three. Outspoken Bills fans shouldn't strap him to an intertube and toss him over Niagara Falls just yet."

S"Housewives of New Jersey beware. Another suggestive Davis end-zone dance this week, and your leopard-printed thongs will disintegrate. The somewhat arrogant former Trojan has quietly excelled in Lewis' revamped offense. Over the past five weeks he's totaled 18 catches, 220 yards and four touchdowns. His resulting 9.2 points per game mark ranks fourth at his position, one spot behind Dallas Clark. Similar to intradivision rival Philadelphia, the Giants simply refuse to shadow tight ends. The loss of Antonio Pierce has only amplified this issue. On the season they've surrendered 69.2 yards per game and eight scores to oversized targets, equal to the second-most fantasy points. Davis, who is Campbell's primary target inside the 20, goes all Chippendale's once again."

S"While TMZ readers anxiously await name news of Brady bundle of joy No. 2, fantasy owners are wondering what happened to the Goldenboy's value. Did witnessing childbirth for a second time permanently damage important parts of his brain? Hindered by myriad injuries (finger, ribs, shoulder), the multi-time Super Bowl champ has barely posted starter-worthy numbers in 12-team leagues over the past four weeks. During that span he's averaged a mere 272.8 yards per game and notched a 4:5 TD:INT split. Accusations of Randy Moss quitting on him last week only complicates matters. Spearheaded by outstanding rookie Jairus Byrd, the Bills secondary is a legit unit. In its past five games, Buffalo has conceded a lowly 188.4 passing yards per game and four touchdowns to passers equal to the fourth-fewest fantasy points. Granted the competition over that stretch was unspectacular (Ten, Jax, Mia, NYJ and KC), but this is the same team that held Drew Brees under 200 yards earlier this year. Brady backers beware."

S"For DeAngelo, the season-ending injury suffered by Jeff Otah is akin to the President losing a key Secret Service member. As a result, fame-crazed couples and hungry tacklers will surely penetrate the backfield. Another magical late-season run for Williams appears farfetched. Though Matt Moore has performed admirably in relief of Jake Delhomme, defenses continue to overload the box, which has stymied the lineup anchor's contributions. Minnesota can be beaten on the peripheries, but unless Moore stretches the field with Steve Smith an extra safety will likely spy the edges to prevent Williams from busting loose. If Carolina is forced to focus their attack between the tackles it could be a long night. The impenetrable Williams Wall has surrendered just 3.9 yards per carry, 92.6 total yards per game and zero scores to RBs since Week 9. More concerning, the Panthers' bullet hasn't reached the end-zone in four straight. If you have more favorable options (i.e. Arian Foster (at StL), Knowshon Moreno (vs. Oak), Jamaal Charles (vs. Cle)) cage the cat."

S"The Noise is convinced Sean Payton is Satan with a headset. Even though Thomas has repeatedly proven he's the most talented back on roster, the rascally coach continues to feed Mike Bell, or in last week's case Reggie Bush, near the pylons. It's maddening. Despite the dissing, the PT Bruiser has maintained substantial value, especially in PPR-heavy formats. Over the past five weeks he's averaged 82.9 total yards per game, much of it via the air (14 receptions in last two). Still, his lost red-zone carries combined with an unsavory matchup are ominous indicators. The Cowboys' aggressive, quick frontline has played brilliantly of late limiting backs to just 3.8 yards per carry and 133.6 total yards per game. His yardage totals will again be stout, but unless he breaks a long run somewhere in-between the 20s his overall production will be mediocre."

S"Another Noise mantasy on the lames list? Someone is seeking an open relationship. Mendenhall's value has tanked alongside his team's chances of defending its championship. The well-rounded rusher ranks No. 22 among backs in points per game over the past five weeks, averaging just 3.9 yards per carry and 89.4 total yards per game. His uninspiring effort last week in Cleveland killed many. This week, another playoff-bouncing effort is likely. Under Dom Caper's direction, the Packers' 3-4 defense has performed splendidly for much of the year. On the season, Green Bay has allowed only 3.5 yards per carry to rushers. And over the past five weeks, it has yielded the fewest fantasy points. After showing signs of a turnaround midseason, Pittsburgh's trench execution has relapsed. Few holes have opened. Mendenhall has received more action on third downs, but in the Steelers' last stand, he'll likely play the role of George Armstrong Custer."

S'Mike Tomlin\'s version of "hell" sounds like paradise to the opposition. Pina coladas anyone? Though Ward gutted out a cumbersome hamstring injury in frigid Cleveland last week, he failed to produce even marginal numbers. The Browns blanketed Steelers wideouts for much of the night. Still not close to 100 percent, he will likely log a disappointing point total for the second consecutive week. Only four receivers have eclipsed the 70-yard mark against Charles Woodson and company since Week 9. Ward typically thrives against zone coverage, but Green Bay\'s dedication to "man" presents a quandary. Keep him active in PPR formats but owners in standard leagues should lean on more favorable alternatives.'

S'The chemistry between Rice and Brett Favre continues to percolate. Over the past five weeks, the high-riser has netted 10.2 targets, six receptions and 98 yards per game. Toss in three touchdowns and he\'s racked the fourth-best per game yield at his position. The Vikings will likely be minus Percy Harvin once again, which will likely draw added attention for Rice. Without the rookie complement last week, he compiled just four catches for 39 yards versus the Bengals, though a touchdown rescued him from Bustville. The Panthers\' defensive credo is "bend, don\'t break." Despite surrendering six 90-yard receiver efforts over the past five weeks, Chris Gamble and his accomplices have only allowed three wideout touchdowns on the year. Rice should tally fair PPR numbers, but don\'t expect an extraordinary effort in standard leagues.'

S'Rowdy Roddy befriended Darrelle Revis at the Pro Bowl in Hawaii last year saying he and the premier cover corner "chopped it up," a phrase which probably isn\'t a reference to recreational logging. This week, Revis solely will do the chopping. As discussed repeatedly in this space, the league\'s most unforgiving Snuggie has limited one Pro Bowl receiver after another. Last week, Antonio Bryant was victimized. On the year, an incredible three receivers have reached the 70-yard mark against the Jets. That\'s what you call shutdown. Chris Redman will force the ball to White\'s side regardless of the matchup. The QB has targeted his No. 1 an average of 13 times per game over the past three weeks. But Redman will quickly find out Lito Sheppard, not Revis, should be picked on. White gets owned.'

Led by man-eater Patrick Willis, the Niners have conceded only one touchdown to tight ends this season and the sixth-fewest fantasy points. Due to San Francisco's collapsing zone scheme, only Owen Daniels and Dallas Clark have eclipsed the 80-yard mark against them. Magnum P.I. has enticed more red-zone targets than any other TE in the league, netting nearly 33.3 percent of his team's looks. He has also crossed the chalk in five of his past seven games. But due to the uncharitable matchup and his sore back, a points-deprived effort is on the horizon."

S"The contributions gap between high-profiled '05 draftees Aaron Rodgers and Smith is shrinking, though it's still Kirstie Alley-wide. Since overtaking the starter's role midseason, the former No. 1 pick has finally reached fantasy puberty. He's executed timing routes crisply and made sound decisions, particularly when operating in the spread. Most importantly, he's connecting with playmakers Vernon Davis, Michael Crabtree and Frank Gore often. Offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye has been hesitant to install a full-blown spread system, but, as Crabtree remarked earlier this week, the play-caller is starting to warm up to the idea. Based on Smith's recent results, Raye should be thinking more liberally. Over his past three games, the maturing quarterback has tossed five touchdowns to just two interceptions. This week his passes should again penetrate the end zone multiple times. In terms of pass defense, the Hawks are a clownish group of flightless Dodos. Since Week 9, they've yielded 274.2 passing yards and 13 touchdowns to passers, equal to the most fantasy points allowed. Seattle has defended Qwest Field remarkably well in recent years, but with its defense reeling, Smith's surge should continue."

S"Moreno's mental maturation has been well documented. According to the Denver Post, his defensive reads have sharpened and pass-blocking improved, which has boosted his confidence. For G.I. Know, mental preparation is indeed half the battle. This year's top RB draft pick is the league's pacesetter in yardage among rookies, which is a noteworthy achievement. However, this season's back class doesn't come close to matching the talent of last season's extraordinary group. Still, Moreno is starting to come around. He's eclipsed the 80-yard mark in three straight and has averaged a stout 5.0 yards per carry in his last five. His excellent performance has staved off Correll Buckhalter, cementing the youngster as Denver's workhorse. With roughly 20 touches he should rack superb numbers against a KC defense that's surrendered 169.5 total yards per game and six scores to rushers since Week 8, equal to the third-most fantasy points allowed. Throw a saddle on this horse. Yee-haw!!!"

Since seizing the starting job full-time in Week 10, the former Longhorn has gouged the opposition, averaging 110 total yards per game with four touchdowns (one return). A plaguing case of fumbilitis has inhibited him somewhat, but his refuse-to-go-down attitude has earned the respect and support of Todd Haley. The Broncos have largely been a two-faced defense this season. Last week against the Giants, they stamped out the run with relative ease. But in other recent outings, most notably versus Pittsburgh, they were gashed. The Chiefs are not particularly adept in the run-blocking department, which doesn't bode well for Charles. But the versatile back's ability to operate on the peripheries via ground and air makes him dangerous no matter the opponent. Including their caging of Brandon Jacobs on Thanksgiving night, Denver has still allowed 4.7 yards per carry 161.5 total yards per game and four scores to rushers over its past five."

S"The little redheaded stepchild of the Panthers backfield won't be the Alfred E. Newman of fantasy rushers in Week 13. Complete domination best summarizes Carolina's first clash with the Buccaneers. DeAngelo Williams and Stewart ran down Tampa's collective throat, each surpassing the century mark in rushing yards. The rematch could be equally lopsided. Raheem Morris relieved Jim Bates of defensive coordinator duties two weeks ago. With the rookie head coach calling the plays on D last week, the Bucs smashed empty rum bottles over the Falcons' heads, holding Michael Turner, Jerious Norwood and Jason Snelling to a combined 63 rushing yards (2.3 ypc). But one sensational effort doesn't mean this defense has transformed overnight. With Matt Moore at the helm, Williams and Stewart will humiliate their NFC South rival. In their past two contests, the Bucs have allowed 566 yards rushing to the Panthers. The Daily Show rolls."

S'Evans will be a thorn in Lito Sheppard\'s side. With Darrelle Revis, who Terrell Owens respectfully noted is "on an island by himself," expected to draw the outspoken wideout, the Buffalo beamer will be the apple of Ryan Fitzpatrick\'s eye. As discussed in Wednesday\'s Fred Jackson embellishment, Perry Fewell has removed the padlocks from the playbook, encouraging his offense to attack opponents aggressively. Fitzpatrick has taken numerous shots downfield, connecting with Owens, and to a lesser extent Evans, on several explosive pass plays. Though the opponent is stiffer, the formula likely won\'t change. The Bills\' No. 2 was targeted 11 times in his first clash with the Jets, catching four passes for 68 yards and a touchdown. North of the border he should shine once again. (in Toronto)'

S'Against a very generous Atlanta secondary, Avant will be a fantasy savant. The fifth-year wideout from Michigan has proven to be occasionally useful this season, developing into a top-flight third weapon for the Eagles. Donovan McNabb has spoken highly of the receiver\'s advancements, noting earlier this week he\'s a "big-time player" who has gained his confidence. With DeSean Jackson very unlikely to play due to last week\'s concussion, Avant and rookie Jeremy Maclin are must starts in Hotlanta. Since the loss of corner Brian Williams earlier this season, the Falcons have been the victims of a vertical blitzkrieg. No defense has conceded more 20-yard pass plays this year. And over the past five weeks, they\'ve yielded the 11th-most fantasy points to receivers. Though LeSean McCoy has been featured more prominently in Marty Mornhinweg\'s gameplan, this is still a pass-first team. Avant could be the biggest fantasy surprise of Week 13.'

S"Due to a mass Bears extermination, taxidermists in the greater Chicago area are working overtime. The Midgets of the Midway have been hunted down vertically with unparalleled success. Giving up a seemingly uncountable number of long pass plays, the Black and Bruised have surrendered five 70-yard receiver performances and six touchdowns to wideouts over the past five weeks, equal to the fifth-most fantasy points allowed. This week, the little football brother down I-55 could be surprisingly competitive. That's right Bears fans. Armageddon has arrived. Avery quietly ranks 22nd at his position in points per game since Week 9, averaging 65 yards with three touchdowns. Because of Chicago's gross insufficiencies in downfield coverage, the smallish wideout's speed will cause headaches. If Kyle Boller can carry over his adequate play from a week ago, Avery will again finish within or just outside the top 20."

S'Facing Tampa\'s turnover prone offense, Carolina has infected the Noise with a case of "Cat Scratch Fever." Josh Freeman has performed well beyond expectations, occasionally delivering precise passes and making plays with his feet. Despite his veteran savvy, he\'s often looked and played like a rookie. Often he\'s held onto the rock too long, which has led to several sacks (11 in five games) and fumbles (seven). Julius Peppers must be licking his chops. Carolina can be skewered in the trenches, but because Tampa doesn\'t have a formidable rushing attack, the Panthers will focus on the pass. In their previous meeting in Week 6 (Josh Johnson QB\'d Tampa), the Panthers coaxed two turnovers and recorded four sacks. This week, the widely available unit could pay a double-digit dividend for only the second time this season.'

S'We\'re extremely hesitant recommending arguably the most explosive passer in the NFC as a lame. Frankly, it\'s the equivalent of including Megan Fox on a list of Hollywood Medusas. But due the stringent rules of this little game, Brees is absurdly designated as such. There is an argument to be made. Washington boasts the best pass defense in the NFL. Over the past five weeks, the \xe2\x80\x98Skins have allowed a mere 189.5 passing yards per game and five touchdowns to passers, equal to the fifth-fewest fantasy points allowed. Brees isn\'t immune from putrid performances. Earlier this season he logged back-to-back sub-200-yard, zero touchdown games against Buffalo and the New York Jets. If Washington doesn\'t bite on ball fakes and double moves (Carlos Rogers!) it could defy the odds. As Jim Zorn said earlier this week, the defense "absolutely must be disciplined" to prevent a blowout. You\'re still starting him, but a third dud effort isn\'t out of the question.'

S'Addai has been the Henry VIII of consistency kings, devouring the competition. Amazingly, he\'s recorded a touchdown in six of his past eight games. Hindered by timidity a season ago, he\'s replaced the dancing shoes with work boots, drawing apologies from fantasy pundits and Colts bloggers. Though on paper he appears to be a slam dunk "flame" against the white-hot Titans, the numbers are somewhat deceiving. Over the past five weeks Tennessee has allowed 6.1 yards per carry to rushers. But over its past three, that number is dramatically lower (4.1 ypc). During their miraculous resurgence, the Titans have finally rediscovered the defensive identity that labeled them one of the NFL\'s most feared units a season ago. Their creative mixture of twists and stunts have often befuddled and confused quarterbacks and stymied the run. With Donald Brown a major question mark, Addai will most certainly net his usual 15-20 touches. But similar to last week in Houston, the results could be bland.'

S'Not even a lifetime supply of Vidal Sassoon products could sway Gary Kubiak from his committee beliefs. The well-combed coach is dedicated to an even distribution between Slaton and backfield "Lurch," Chris Brown. More frustrating is his commitment to giving the upright runner the ball inside the red zone. Since Week 9, Brown has three times more carries inside the 20 than Slaton. Because of his featured role as a pass catcher, The Slasher is still must start material in PPR-intensive formats. But for standard leaguers, he\'s a matchup-only play. This week, he deserves to ride the pine in shallow leagues. Lately, the Wild Card-hunting Jags have tightened up their interior defense. Since Week 9 they\'ve conceded just 118.6 total yards per game and four touchdowns to rushers, equal to the eighth-fewest fantasy points allowed. Another mundane effort is on the horizon.'

S"The Football Frankenstein is a caricature of his former intimidating self. New York's once impenetrable offensive line has been repeatedly pillaged by aggressive, quick defenses. In turn, Jacobs has run more east-west than north-south, leading casual observers to believe he's lost his edge. Truthfully, the monstrous runner is fine physically. Being such a large rusher, he needs an adequate lane to gain steam in the open-field. He's simply been gifted few. Unless the Giants line turns back the clock, Dallas' fast-attacking defense will reign over the line of scrimmage, an occurrence which has happened routinely of late. Since Week 9, the \xe2\x80\x98Boys have surrendered just 4.0 yards per carry and one touchdown to rushers, equal to the sixth-fewest fantasy points allowed. At this point last year, Jacobs had four 100-yard games under his belt. This year, he's yet to eclipse the century mark. Unfortunately, even possibly without Ahmad Bradshaw in uniform, that streak will likely continue."

Chris Redman is a capable backup, but Philly's blitz-crazed defense is an untamable unit which will surely rattle the pocket. So far this season, only one wideout has surpassed the 80-yard mark against the Eagles. Over the past five weeks, they've also surrendered the 11th-fewest fantasy points to WRs. Stretching back to '07 White has averaged six receptions, 80.8 yards per game and totaled four scores with Redman at the controls.

Evident in their No. 8 ranking in most 20-yard pass plays allowed, the Ravens have been victimized vertically. However, they've shown significant improvement in pass defense in recent weeks.

Football's favorite court jester playfully told the Detroit Free Press this week he wished people referred to him as Ochotron or Optimus Tron. This week, the leader of the Decepticons will likely be outperformed by his admirer. Johnson, who has been bothered by myriad injuries for weeks, is expected to play without restriction. However, Leon Hall will apply the shackles. Johnson has outmaneuvered double coverage for most of the season, but the Bengals' bracket scheme is more unforgiving than most. Only one receiver has reached the 50-yard mark against Cincy since Week 9. The Queen City Cats have also surrendered the fewest fantasy points to wideouts during that span. The Lions are slowly rebuilding, but this week, in what easily could be a shutout, the Bengals will force them to take a step back."

S"Miller is in the midst of a breakout season. He's already established a new career high in receptions and is currently on pace to obliterate previous benchmarks in yards and touchdowns. But despite his across-the-board advancements, the enlarged target has been fairly unreliable, especially of late. Since Week 7, he's found the end zone just once and has eclipsed 40 yards in a game an equal number of times. This week, he will again be forgotten. Due to their shortcomings upfront, the Raiders have yet to allow a touchdown to a tight end this season. Overall, they've also yielded the third-fewest fantasy points to the position. Simply put: when near the goal-line, teams have chosen to run the ball. Pittsburgh is unquestionably a pass-first team, but with Ben Roethlisberger banged up, Rashard Mendenhall is sure to shoulder a substantial portion of the offensive load, particularly inside the red zone."

S'The buildup to Flacco\'s projected breakthrough season has a similar sound to Phil Collins\' "In the Air Tonight." Quiet and creeping in the preseason, his percussion-heavy crescendo could be reached immediately. One of the worst defensive units in tackle football a season ago, KC, under the guidance of Todd Haley, made only minor improvements over the offseason. Last year, the Chiefs surrendered 237.9 passing yards and 1.5 air strikes per game, equal to the 11th-most fantasy points allowed to QBs. Flacco was noticeably sharp in preseason action, completing over 65 percent of his attempts. Though Clancy Pendergast will throw variable stunts and twists at the young signal caller, which he is concerned about, the Ravens\' offensive line and suitable dump-off weapons should prove devastating. Flacco\'s been waiting for this moment all his life, oh lord...'

S"With Pierre Thomas limited to pedaling on a stationary bike Wednesday, it appears the Week 1 star of '06 could recapture the magic he briefly flashed under Lucifer Shanahan. In our riveting conversation with Thomas last Friday, the PT Bruiser, whose soothing voice could comfort the Noise during a nuclear firestorm, spoke highly of his teammate's preseason progression. His praise is understandable. A trimmed down, recommitted Bell compiled an otherworldly 7.7 yards per carry mark, gaining the respect of Sean Payton. Detroit should show some improvement on defense this year, but collectively the unit is still a sieve. Recall a year ago the loathsome Lions conceded 5.4 yards per carry, 189.8 total yards and 1.8 TDs per contest to rushers equal to the most fantasy points allowed. The former Bronco will split touches with Bush, but his pounding interior style will earn him sizable red zone touches. Exploit the matchup."

S'Leon the Leprechaun could be rookie Mark Sanchez\'s "Lucky Charm" of sorts this season. Quick, nimble, explosive and ultra-versatile, the lethal weapon\'s skill set immediately captured the attention of new head coach Rex Ryan in training camp. Expected to tote the rock more this season, Washington should net roughly 15 touches in his \xe2\x80\x9809 debut. Because of the Jets\' stout offensive line and Houston\'s willingness to surrender big plays, he\'s must start material even in shallow formats. Last season, the Texans allowed 148.6 total yards and 1.2 touchdowns per contest to RBs equal to the eighth most fantasy points conceded. Marshall Faulk said recently Washington\'s elusiveness and burst was comparable to Barry Sanders\'. Given the matchup and situation, the miniature back may indeed emulate the Sandman.'

S"Even with minimal touches, San Diego's ball of lightning will singe the few remaining hairs on Al Davis' head. Considering LaDainian Tomlinson's advanced age, Norv Turner will turn to Sproles approximately 10-12 times per contest to ease the burden. Because the Raiders' 4-3 unit has performed pathetically against the run in recent seasons - they allowed 172.7 total yards and 1.7 scores to rushers last year - the Pocket Rocket's chances of breaking a long play via ground or air are favorable. In '08, Sproles averaged 40.5 total yards per contest and splashed pay-dirt twice in two appearances against the Silver and Black. Slide him into the flex spot in deeper leagues."

Recovering from offseason shoulder surgery during most of training camp, last season's surprise wire sensation was constantly overlooked in drafts. Back at full-strength, Moore worked tirelessly with Drew Brees on slants and hooks after practice in August determined to prove '08 wasn't a fluke. That established rapport will be deadly against a Detroit secondary that yielded ten 90-yard receivers a season ago. Marques Colston is option No. 1, but Brees' secondary choice is poised to pick up where he left off."

S'With Michael Crabtree feeding Benjamins to his pet goat, Morgan is primed to steal the spotlight many thought would be reserved for San Fran\'s top draft choice. An incredibly gifted athlete with the necessary tools to be a dependable asset, the second-year receiver is on the precipice of stardom. Offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye still feels Morgan is a "developing player," but emphasized if he makes the proper mental preparations, Niners fans and the fantasy community will see a "flourishing, good player." During the regular season last year, Arizona\'s secondary was several steps below atrocious. In total, the vulnerable unit allowed 24 touchdowns to wideouts, the most in the league. Because shootouts are common in the desert, the emerging Morgan is a commodity to trust opening week.'

S"According to numerous reports and observations, the 34-year-old Driver is in the best shape of his career. The chiseled wideout, who is motivated by the almighty dollar, wants to maintain an image of consistency. Matched against a Bears secondary which could be without the services of Charles Tillman, the veteran could once again cage his arch NFC North foe. Last season in two contests against the Black and Blue, he snagged 10 passes for 123 yards. With Aaron Rodgers peaking, Driver's role cemented within Green Bay's dynamite spread system and Chicago's sketchy secondary; he has excellent odds of posting standout Week 1 numbers. Keep in mind the Bears allowed the third-most fantasy points to WRs in '08."

Cleveland was one of the league's premiere defenses against tight ends a season ago conceding just one touchdown. But the instant chemistry forged between Shiancoe and Brett Favre cannot be underestimated. Within Brad Childress' West Coast scheme, the short-field will be dominated by the veteran weapon. Based on his marked athleticism, speed and strength, the breakthrough candidate will prove difficult to contain for any defense. Start Shiancoe with confidence in all formats."

S'Not falling under the "Always start your studs" axiom, Romo is a pine-worthy prospect this week. For the first time in over a decade, the Buccs plan to stray away from the Dungy-implemented Cover 2, installing a more diverse, complicated and aggressive scheme. As Raheem Morris discussed Wednesday, applying copious pressure on the pocket will be a critical part of Tampa\'s gameplan. Historically tough at home, Ronde Barber and company allowed just three multi-TD passers in eight contests at the Ray. If the Buccs were comprised of gorgeous blondes, Romo would have a field day, but with Roy Williams dinged and given the QB\'s rollercoaster preseason, he\'s untrustworthy on the road.'

In two clashes with his divisional rival a season ago, Portis tallied a lowly 3.1 yards per carry, 50.5 total yards per game and zero touchdowns. More discouraging, in his nine-year career, he\'s averaged a mere 4.0 yards per carry and 78 rushing yards per game against New York. The Drag Queen of Mean has spoken highly of the \xe2\x80\x98Skins\' offensive line, but the Giants\' D-lineman should be able to puncture the backfield often, severely hindering his points scoring potential.'

S"Captain Quick is unmistakably the AFC's preeminent home-run hitter. But piercing Pittsburgh's stifling 3-4 defense is normally a fruitless endeavor, especially at Heinz Field. Last year, the Steelers yielded zero 100-yard rushers, 3.4 yards per carry and the second-fewest fantasy points to RBs. Johnson was moderately successful against Steely McBeam in his lone effort a season ago, totaling 70 yards and a score. However, the underwhelming performance of the Titans' offensive line during the preseason combined with the Steelers' unbendable frontline is worrisome. Benching your first-round pick may seem absurd, but the paper matchup is definitely unattractive."

S'The Barbarian will wield a sock puppet rather than his customary battleaxe this week in Tampa. With a steady diet of "relentless pressure" on the menu, Barber\'s best bet for posting admirable numbers will likely be through the air. Last season, visiting rushers averaged just 3.6 yards per carry and 80.5 rushing yards at the Ray. Michael Bush and Pierre Thomas were the only plowshares who scored. More damaging, Jason Garrett recently suggested Felix Jones, who performed laudably during exhibition play in the red zone, could wrest away touches in between-the-tackles situations. For owners who sank a second-round pick in the Dallas starter, Week 1 is only the beginning of what could be the Year of the Felix.'

S"Every tumultuous training camp, Smith seems to emerge from the turmoil unscathed. But with the hard-hitting Eagles defense on the docket, he could be poised for a letdown this go-round. Led by Quintin Mikell and exorbitant acquisition Asante Samuel, Philly's secondary is one of the finest corps in the NFC. Because Smith is slippery and very dangerous in space, look for defensive coordinator Sean McDermott to stress press coverage. Though largely consistent, Smith will occasionally vanish at times like he did in Weeks 10 and 16 last year. Based on the matchup, he very easily could be a source of marginality."

S"To the Buffalo Bills, 3-4 defenses remain giant, unsolvable Sudoku puzzles. Struggling immensely against the Packers and Steelers in preseason action, the offense has often looked discombobulated and lethargic, which explains why Turk Schonert was canned. Unsurprisingly, the vocal Owens has already expressed his disdain for the no huddle scheme. If Jim Kelly was his QB, he might think otherwise. The Patriots secondary was vertically challenged at times last season, yielding the sixth-most fantasy points to wideouts. However, no Bills receiver eclipsed 65 yards against Beezlechick's bunch. Due to Buffalo's offensive woes against the 3-4 (Note: The Pats have switched primarily to a 4-3 scheme, but they will surely turn back the clock to frustrate the Bills) the popcorn won't be poppin' in Foxboro for the Orville Redenbacher of receivers."

S'Following Brandon Marshall\'s Handbook on Explosive Temper Tantrums word-for-word throughout the preseason, Bowe\'s egomaniacal attitude was not fondly received by new head coach Todd Haley. Demoted at one time to the scout team, the cumbersome receiver at first responded negatively to Haley\'s tough-love approach. But, as the coach divulged earlier this week, the former LSU standout has "made very good progress; he\'s starting to get it." Though Bowe\'s "come to Jesus" moment is encouraging, his matchup in Baltimore is everything but. Only eight receivers surpassed the 70-yard mark last season against the suffocating Ravens. With Matt Cassel\'s status undetermined and the KC offensive line a squalid mess, the Chiefs offense will likely flounder in every facet of the game. Chris Henry (vs. Den), Earl Bennett (at GB) and Chris Chambers (at Oak) are more reliable options.'

S"Gonzalez is arguably the greatest tight end in NFL history. However, in his Falcons debut, his iconic image could be tarnished. Though the dependable target isn't worried about his expected looks decline, the fantasy community certainly is. He'll still be one of the position's most targeted weapons, but sharing the sugar with Roddy White and Michael Jenkins will prove problematic at times. More worrisome, Atlanta's dedication to feeding The Burner inside the red zone could limit Gonzalez's TD prowess. The future HOFer was the only tight end to score against Miami last year. But the Fins' familiarity with him squashes the element of surprise. Undoubtedly, Joey Porter will have the oversized target lined up in the crosshairs."

S"For whatever reason, the fantasy community must feel Palmer carries a contagion. Despite eclipsing 20 fantasy points in three of his past four games, most continue to keep the signal caller at arm's length. However, this week, because of bye week hell, fanatics need to trust his services. Palmer pinned last week's giveaway in Atlanta on himself blaming his poor ball security and mental missteps for the loss. Back in the Black Hole, look for him to kiss and make-up with the Raiders faithful. Defensively, the Jaguars are the new Hello Kitties of the NFL. Pounded via ground and air, they are an overly generous defense. Over the past three weeks, Andrew Luck, Andy Dalton and Jay Cutler each threw for at least 244 yards and two touchdowns against them. On the season, corners Rashean Mathis and Aaron Ross have allowed a QB rating of 106.2. Due to Darren McFadden's ongoing inconsistencies and with Denarius Moore blossoming, Palmer will be leaned on Sunday. Bank on the man in black."

S"It's true Jones would likely shred a ligament reading a book. The delicate back, who the Noise pimped heavily preseason last year, excels at disappointment. But with DeMarco Murray out of action for the foreseeable future due to ligament damage in his foot, the once overhyped commodity has a chance at redemption. Don't expect him to spoil his second chance. Considering its gross inadequacies defending the run, a mortally wounded walrus would likely drag its way to 100-yards and a touchdown against Carolina. This season, the Panthers have routinely received failing grades on gap assignments. On the year, they've surrendered 4.8 yards per carry 123 rushing yards per game and the most receiving yards to RBs. In relief of Murray, Jones looked spectacular last week in Baltimore. He attacked the line, forced missed tackles and was quick around the edge, a far cry from the out of shape rusher who failed a conditioning test in training camp. On 19 touches he totaled 105 yards, 55 of which were after contact. Yes, Phillip Tanner will wrest away roughly 10-12 touches, but if the Dallas offensive line can dominate the line of scrimmage again and Jones can stave off the injury imp, he's in line to post top-12 numbers in Week 7. Start him with confidence."

S'Though Doug Martin is the clear-cut No. 1 by the Bay, there\'s a puff or three still left in Blount. No longer in need of car service, the "Lazy" rusher purchased an alarm clock, has shown up to team meetings on time and has put in the work, earning the respect of Greg Schiano and his teammates. As a result his snap count has steadily risen over the past three weeks climbing from 6-to-12-to-18. His seven carries for 58 yards and a score in a blowout win against Kansas City in Week 6 was his finest fantasy performance since Week 14 last year. In the encore, don\'t be surprised if he totes the rock 10-plus times for the first time in 2012. Unsurprisingly, the Saints are rather \'hole-y\' on defense, particularly up the middle. In five games, they\'ve yielded 5.0 yards per carry, 141.2 rushing yards per game and six end-zone plunges to RBs, equal to the most fantasy points allowed. In order to control clock and keep Drew Brees on the sidelines for as long as possible, look for Schiano to feature a power run game with Martin and Blount. If the much improved Tampa defense, especially the secondary, can rise to the challenge and keep the game competitive, the backup is in line for a top-24 day. FLEX him in 12-team and deeper leagues.'

S"Don't call him 'Debbie.' Filling the void for injured starter Danny Amendola, Gibson stepped up last week in Miami catching seven passes (on nine targets) for a career-best 91 yards, including a one-handed Madden-esque grab. At times over his four-year tenure in the league, he's shown flashes of star potential, but misroutes and a lack of chemistry with Sam Bradford made him wildly erratic. But it appears he's learned form the mental mistakes, realizing the personal opportunity currently at stake. Green Bay, uneven defensively over the first few weeks of the season, was dynamite in coverage last week, vexing Matt Schaub on numerous occasions. Still, evident against Indianapolis a couple weeks ago, the Packers secondary can be exploited. Though it's unlikely Bradford will channel the football ghost of Kurt Warner, he will likely be pressed into a high volume situation, enhancing Gibson's scoring potential. In a performance worthy of a Garbage All-Star nom, the wideout could clean-up late. Employ him as a WR3 in 12-team and deeper PPR leagues."

S'For the sake of his queasy supporters, Britt better cover his gloves in reversible tape. Though his final stat line was commendable last week versus Pittsburgh (4-62-1), the wideout didn\'t make it look easy, plagued by a case of the bobbles. Mike Munchak blamed Britt\'s skittishness on the receiver\'s missed practice time and learning curve with the club\'s revised playbook. But the health of his surgically repaired knee is no longer a concern. If he can master the offense quickly, he should produce steady yields moving forward, starting this week versus Buffalo He\'s simply too talented not to. "Unkind" best describes how opponents have treated the Bills this year. Nine wide receivers have scored at least 10 fantasy points against them. Combined Stephon Gilmore and Aaron Williams have allowed 16.0 yards per catch. Because of Britt\'s big-play ability, look for Matt Hasselbeck to target him early and often downfield, en route to his finest effort yet this season.'

S"Weeden, who fought alongside Zach Taylor during the Mexican-American War, may be ancient for a rookie, but he's shown plenty of piss and vinegar over the past five weeks. During that stretch he's totaled at least 231 passing yards in each game and tallied a respectable 7:6 TD:INT split. At times he's been overly reckless, but forging a strong relationship with home run hitter Josh Gordon of late, Weeden has connected on a number of explosive pass plays. And according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer's very scientific study of each of his throws against Cincinnati, the passer is coming off his finest performance to date. Teams have battered Indy most often between the tackles, but they've also registered a great deal of vertical success. Four quarterbacks have found the end-zone twice in a game versus the Colts this year. Count on Weeden becoming the fifth. Keep in mind if Trent Richardson sits, Pat Shurmur may install a more air-minded game-plan. Better yet, the Browns' wayward defense could turn this contest into a shootout."

S"Somehow it appears the Madden Curse has infected Stafford and not the video game's cover athlete, Calvin Johnson. The popular second-round pick, off one of the greatest QB seasons in NFL history, has seen a precipitous drop in production. Plagued by turnovers and misconnects, he's yet to tally a multi-TD passing game this season. Still, he remains on pace to throw an arm-taxing 697 times this season, which would best his franchise record 663 attempts from a year ago. Unfortunately, his dip in YPA ('11: 7.6, '12: 6.8) and red-zone inefficiency continue to keep him outside the QB top-12 in per game average. So does his uneven performance in-game. Evident in last week's thrilling win in Philly, Stafford has become the league's latest comeback king. His fourth quarter QB rating 103.9 completely dwarfs what little he's accomplished earlier in games (1st: 48.1, 2nd: 58.7, 3rd: 80.1). If he didn't sleepwalk through first halves, he would easily be a top-five signal caller. Consistency will be key for Stafford Monday night in Chicago. Tim Jennings and company have yet to allow a multi-TD passer and have given up a mere 6.1 yards per attempt. Earlier this season, proven passers Aaron Rodgers and Tony Romo failed to reach the 20-fantasy point mark against the Bears. Stafford was a turnover machine the last time he visited the Windy City, throwing four picks. In the rematch, anticipate a similar outcome."

S"The impact of Ray Lewis' loss on the Ravens isn't limited to defense. His on-field presence and leadership will most certainly take a team-wide toll. It's possible the Ravens could use it as a rallying cry. They could also crumble, leaving owners hoping for favorable returns on both sides of the ball dejected. It's extremely rare Rice's name is mentioned in this space. He's arguably the league's most versatile weapon, a certifiable PPR behemoth. He's finished in 'Lame' territory only three times in his past 24 games. Accurately predicting a Rice letdown is akin to stumbling across 'binders full of women' -- slim odds. Still, Houston, even minus premier run stopper Brian Cushing, is capable of forking Rice. Bradie James, who filled the massive void left by Cushing, graded out nearly the same against the run last week against Green Bay as the former All-Pro did in his previous five games. Granted the Ravens are a more formidable ground foe, the replacement's effort was nothing to scoff at. The Texans, collectively, are one of fantasy's stingiest run defenses. They've yet to surrender a RB rushing TD and largely held established commodities Reggie Bush, Maurice Jones-Drew and Willis McGahee in check. Of all people, Chris Johnson is the only rusher to hurdle the 70-yard mark on the ground versus Houston this year. It's serious HUEVOS, but it's not improbable Rice bombs in H-Town."

S"A tango with San Francisco, fresh off allowing its first 100-yard rusher at Candlestick in 21 regular games, means Lynch could be more 'Least' than 'Beast' Mode. No amount of Skittles can prepare him for the defensive onslaught. The Niners, worn down by the incessant pounding issued by the Giants offensive line and Ahmad Bradshaw, didn't resemble their usual immovable selves. It's unlikely to happen again. After all, Russell Wilson is no Eli Manning. San Francisco, unlike last week, can isolate its focus on containing the opponent's strength, the run, which it failed to do the last time the division counterparts met face to face. Last year in Week 16, Lynch rolled up 134 total yards and a touchdown against the Gold Panners. However, that happened in Seattle. In the rematch, San Fran will get the best of the Beast. Even after last week's misstep, the Niners have still allowed just 3.3 yards per carry and the second-fewest fantasy points to RBs. Lynch is an animal after initial contact, but expect him to find few treats in San Francisco."

S"With Kevin Kolb sidelined by tender ribs for the next several weeks, John Skelton is set to man the controls for sliding 'Zona. Most fanalysts would contend the QB change is a major win for Fitzgerald. Skelton's tunnel vision for the wide receiver is well-documented. When No. 19 has taken first-team reps, a span of 13 starts, he and Fitz have combined for seven touchdowns and 10.5 targets, 5.6 receptions and 90.5 yards per game. Still, it's shortsighted to believe the pair will instantly rekindle their on-field love out of the gate. From a fantasy perspective, the MetroDome doesn't exactly scream 'Romance!' As most are well aware, the Cardinals couldn't protect the pocket from a line of legless basset hounds. Cardinals QBs have been sacked 28 times this year, the most in the NFL. Skelton has a quicker release than Kolb, but he's a fixed object. For Jared Allen and the rest of Minnesota's dogged front, he will look like a freshly cooked goose. If badgered relentlessly, Skelton's chances of connecting with Fitz downfield are limited. Keep in mind, among WRs, only Donnie Avery has surpassed 75 yards against Antoine Winfield and friends this year. In a homecoming of sorts for the Minnesota native, he won't be crowned king."

S'For "Gumby," a clash with Antonio Cromartie isn\'t very appealing. For one, the possibility of unwanted pregnancy is uncomfortably high. And so is the potential to underwhelm statistically. Against receivers with prototype frames, Cromartie usually operates at the highest level. Previously, he locked down Andre Johnson, Michael Crabtree, and, for 3.5 quarters, Reggie Wayne. Overall, he checks in as the eighth-best cover-man according to Pro Football Focus, conceding just a 41.7 catch percentage to assignments. Lloyd bruised his shoulder late last week in Seattle, but returned to a full practice Wednesday. Even though he\'s close to full strength and possesses freakish athleticism, he could fall victim to the matchup this week. Remember, New England has leaned more heavily on the run this year, ranking No. 1 in rush attempts per game. Given the Jets\' shortcomings stopping the run, Stevan Ridley will likely be the centerpiece of the game-plan this week.'

S"It's been a tale of two seaons for the self-described 'elite' quarterback. He blew the doors off in his first four starts averaging 317.3 passing yards per game while totaling a 7:3 TD:INT split. According to many league analysts, his comfort-level in Baltimore's newly installed no-huddle offense would finally lead the overhyped quarterback to fantasy riches. Naturally, in the weeks that followed, he fell off the statistical cliff. Since Week 5, he's eclipsed 16-points in standard leagues only twice, netting a very mundane 221.2 passing yards and 1.0 touchdowns per game. By all means, pin the blame on Cam Cameron. His history of ineptitude play-calling ranks up there with Norv Turner (Ray Rice 13 touches against Pittsburgh? Please, can Cam!).  Still, despite his wild inconsistencies, Flacco is worth resting your playoff hopes on in Week 14. When gifted a favorable matchup (e.g. Week 10 vs. Oakland), the Raven is more than capable of taking flight. Washington is one such opportunity. New Orleans is the only defense that's conceded more fantasy points to passers than the 'Skins. Ten signal callers in 12 games have tallied at least 20 points against them, including 'megastars' Christian Ponder and Sam Bradford. In a game that promises ample scoring, the Flacco Seagulls deserves plenty of airplay."

S"A firestorm almost always begins with a spark. On Twitter it starts with a mere statement. Sunday night during the Eagles/Cowboys game an observational tweet by yours truly awoke LeSean McCoy zealots from hibernation. The boastful Brown-might-be-better reflection wasn't hyperbole. Sure, the sample size is small and his past two matchups were far from daunting, but his explosive open-field wheels, superb vision, decisiveness and versatility are star trademarks. His humbling bout of fumblitis is a major concern, but Brown's baseline skills are spectacular. Recall, he was the No. 1 high school recruit in the country in 2008 per Rivals. Though a bit of a head-case in college, which soured his draft stock, the seventh-round pick has accumulated more yards in his first two starts than any other Eagles back, ever, including McCoy. In fact, according to Elias, he's only the second player since the merger to rack 100 yards and two rushing touchdowns in his first two starts. The other, another RB afterthought on draft day, Arian Foster. This week's tango with Tampa presents Brown's toughest test yet. No team has surrendered fewer rushing yards per game (70.9) than the Bucs. Only Alfred Morris and Adrian Peterson have surpassed 75 ground yards against them. But Brown is a special talent in the midst of statistical puberty. His ability to consume yards via ground and air will easily push him over the century mark in total yardage for the third-straight week. With Eagles in evaluation mode and McCoy still not fully recovered from a concussion \xe2\x80\x94 as of Monday, he's in Phase 3 of 5 of the NFL post-concussion process \xe2\x80\x94 he should tote the load again this week, and possibly the rest of the season. Bottom line: Brown is this year's C.J. Spiller, a top-10 RB who will carry owners to championship glory."

S"After displaying flashes of brilliance preseason, the buzz surrounding Wilson was deafening just three months ago. The highly touted rookie was expected to shoulder the light end of New York's projected 60-40 split, and possibly more given Ahmad Bradshaw's peanut brittle state. But fumbling against the Cowboys opening night placed him in Tom Coughlin's doghouse. Several tears and weeks later, the rookie is back where he started. Andre Brown's season-ending leg injury in Week 12, paved the way for Wilson to log a noteworthy load Monday. Sadly, he didn't. Though he only gripped the pigskin four times for a meager nine yards in Washington, the youngster could finally splash onto the scene this week against New Orleans. On the year, the Saints have given up 5.1 yards per carry and 182.3 total yards per game to RBs equal to the most fantasy points allowed. And many of those totals were notched by secondary options. Timeshare backs DeAngelo Williams and Ronnie Hillman compiled noteworthy numbers against the Saints. On roughly 10-12 touches, he is a strong candidate for 60-80 total yards and a TD."

S"Though inventor of the wheel, Charlie Batch, played admirably in last week's stunning upending of Baltimore on the road, the Steelers offense minus Ben Roethlisberger, for the most part, has resembled an obese octogenarian attempting to cross a wide street \xe2\x80\x94 very pedestrian. Misconnects, smallish gains, three and outs \xe2\x80\x94 it isn't the smashmouth spread fantasy fans have grown accustomed to seeing  under Mike Tomlin. But Big Ben has a legitimate shot of returning this week, which, assuming it happens, would greatly bolster a Pittsburgh club vying to cement its position in the wildcard race. Par for the course under nincompoop Norv, San Diego is currently in the midst of its usual swoon. Fairly rigid defensively not long ago, the Chargers have lost their juice, particularly versus the pass. Peyton Manning, Andy Dalton and the aforementioned Flacco each topped 21 fantasy points against them. Overall, starting corners Quentin Jammer and Antoine Cason rank outside the top-50 in coverage according to Pro Football Focus. Even if Big Ben doesn't play, Brown, who was targeted 10 times in Week 13, is a strong candidate for WR top-24 numbers."

S"On a per game basis, Wright hasn't exactly won the war. His 6.3 ppw output in standard settings ranks No. 63 among wideouts. But in a road clash against Indy, look for the rookie to win the battle. As Y!'s own intrepid reporter, Jason Cole, noted Monday, questions continue to loom about Jake Locker's accuracy. In an era where high completion percentages are inescapable, hitting your teammates at a 56.6-percent clip simply isn't cutting the mustard.  But with Chris Palmer terminated, it appears the Titans will turn to the air often down the stretch. Though he played mostly from behind against Houston last week, Locker chucked it 46 times. Wright, targeted 10 times, caught six passes for 78 yards. Matched against another explosive offense, a similar workload could be in the offing for the wideout. Perusing what type of receiver has done damage against the Colts this season, several have been shifty, underneath weapons (e.g. Davone Bess, Julian Edelman, Randall Cobb and Percy Harvin) akin to Wright. In other words, put a quarter in the slot versus Indy, and chances are you'll hit the PPR jackpot. Overall, the Colts have allowed the fifth-most fantasy points to WRs. As a WR3 in 12-team-plus leagues, Wright won't be wrong."

S"For deep-thinking owners desperately seeking a TE rental primed to serve a platter of points, look no further than 'The Chef.' Ryan Broyles, who was quickly rocketing up the WR ranks, suffered a torn ACL in Sunday's loss against Indy, a huge blow to the Lions' vertical attack. Tantrum thrower Titus Young would be an ideal replacement, but his gross insubordination has him on the outside looking in. Mike Thomas, acquired from Jacksonville earlier this year, is slated to start opposite Calvin Johnson, which leaves Scheffler to man the slot, a position he's very familiar with. The ex-Bronco isn't a drag racer, but he's a very adept route runner with terrific hands and size, a legit matchup nightmare for opposing defenses. With Detroit's affinity for three-receiver sets, he should get plenty of action at Lambeau. Despite seeing just 45.8-percent of snaps over the past two weeks, he reeled in 11 passes for 112 yards. Yes, Green Bay has locked down on tight ends for much of the season. Scheffler and Brandon Pettigrew totaled an unexciting 6-44-0 in the first matchup. But Kyle Rudolph proved quite useful against the Pack last week posting six receptions for 51 yards and a TD. And understand no two games are ever the same, unless it involves San Francisco/St. Louis. On 10-plus targets, Scheffler scores a top-10 line in the rematch."

S"Over the past five weeks, Ryan's fantasy value has hung in a meat locker. Chilled by three sub-20 point efforts in five games, the once fiery commodity has cooled significantly. His inexplicable 165-1-0 line against New Orleans, the league's friendliest pass defense, was dumbfounding. Just three weeks prior he burned the division rival for 411 yards and three touchdowns. Maddening. With a pair of explosive wide receivers (Roddy White and Julio Jones), a future Hall of Fame tight end (Tony Gonzalez) and questionable rushing attack, weekly expectations for Ryan are understandably high. He should throw for 300-2 every time he steps on the field. In a virtual game where values can swing in the blink of an eye, what's happened to the passer isn't unfounded. Just look at the rapid ascension of Russell Wilson. In Fantasyland, surprises, good or bad, lurk behind every corner. Ryan was spectacular in his first meeting with Carolina back in Week 4, tallying 369 yards and three touchdowns. However, the Panthers have surrendered the fifth-fewest passing touchdowns and fifth-fewest 20-plus yard pass plays this season. Since Ryan's 30-point scoregasm, only Josh Freeman in Week 11 has surpassed 20 points in a game against the new Hello Kitties. And that's against the likes of RGIII (16.1 fpts), Peyton Manning (19.5) and Tony Romo (16.5). If you have a strong crutch, ground the Falcon."

S"Written off by many, including yours truly, during draft season, the grizzled veteran hasn't taken the backward step that was predicted. Running behind an offensive line capable of opening holes wide enough for a blue whale, Gore has averaged a sensational 4.9 yards per carry and is just 30 yards shy of 1,000 yards on the year. His subsequent 12.9 points per game average in standard formats checks in at No. 9 at his position. Despite his studly appearance, the golden commodity could be fantasy pyrite in Week 14. Against straight-line rushers with similar skills as Gore, Miami has held its own. Marshawn Lynch, BenJarvus Green-Ellis and Steven Jackson each failed to register a 10-point fantasy day against the 'Fins. Suffice it to say, no matter how terrific the run-blocking, most offenses tally numerous three yard gains against Cameron Wake and company. RBs have averaged just 3.6 yards per carry against them this year. Throw in Colin Kaepernick's poaching ways, and Gore 'The Snore' is slated to make a cameo in Week 14."

S"It's becoming increasingly obvious, Ravens offensive coordinator Cam Cameron would struggle scoring points on Tecmo Super Bowl. The man is a buffoon. His incredible misappropriation of Baltimore's best offensive weapon against Pittsburgh last week cannot be overstated. Rice, once of the game's best closers, failed to record a single carry in the fourth quarter of a hotly contested game, a shocking result the rusher chocked up to 'situational football.' Overall, he registered just 13 touches. Utterly moronic. Historically, after Cameron brain-farts, Rice is usually gifted 20-plus touches the following week. This season, Weeks 9 and 11 are prime examples. But even if presented a hefty workload, the multi-time Pro Bowler may not churn out a star-worthy line. Similar to Tampa, Washington sells out the pass to contain the run. On the year, only Jonathan Dwyer and Ahmad Bradshaw have reached 85 yards on the ground against it. In total, the 'Skins have allowed the sixth-fewest fantasy points to RBs. Because of Rice's dynamite versatility, his PPR contributions will again be useful, but for those in standard formats a playoff letdown is in the forecast."

S"Undeniably one of the most underrated producers over the past several weeks, Shorts has blossomed into a legitimate WR1 even in shallow formats. The apple of Chad Henne's eye is one the league's brightest young play-makers. Several times he's converted an 8-yard shallow cross into an explosive gain, using his blazing open-field speed to capitalize on defensive mismatches. Over the past five weeks, he's hung with the position's greatest heavyweights ranking No. 7 in standard league per game average (12.9), one spot behind Demaryius Thomas. More remarkable, he's scored at least 13.7 fan points in four straight. Unfortunately, all good things eventually come to an end. And in the case of the spirited wideout, a date with Antonio Cromartie could lead his owners to their playoff demise. On a team full of punchlines, the Jets corner is the only person that shouldn't be taken lightly. His assignments have caught just 42.2 percent of targeted passes and he's surrendered a laudable 61.5 QB rating. Shorts must past post-concussion tests this week to ensure availability, but if cleared, the Jag has a tall task ahead."

S"Only four weeks ago, many 12-team owners would've described Moore as a reliable WR2. From Weeks 3-10, he compiled a 8.6-4.4-72.6 per game output and crossed the chalk five times. Because of Oakland's overly generous defense and Carson Palmer's flourishing nature, especially in garbage time, it seemed he would be a starting lineup staple for the remainder of the season. Oh how quickly times change. Since Week 10, he's grabbed a mere four receptions for 60 yards and a score. More troubling, he was benched in favor of rookie Rod Streater late last week against Cleveland. Post-game, Raiders head honcho cited 'drops' as the reason for the hook. Though Moore is expected to start Thursday, he shouldn't for supporters hoping to survive and advance. Despite his old age, Champ Bailey continues to execute at a high level. He and tag-team partner Chris Harris have yielded a 71.3 QB rating. Considering Moore's soft-ground standing and tough one-on-one matchup, a Denarius disaster could be in the offing. Weigh alternatives."

Over his uneventful three-year career, the former No. 1 pick has delivered only lukewarm results, making him a waiver wire staple even in highly competitive leagues. Only twice this season he\'s finished inside the position\'s top-10. However, to be fair, Bradford has shown break out potential at times under Jeff Fisher. He feels very comfortable in the spread and admits the team-wide attitude change has been refreshing. The \'stache possesses magical powers. Coming off his finest performance of the year, a 377-yard, 3-TD bombardment of Minnesota, the former Oklahoma Sooner is in position to carry over his \'boomer\' ways. A headless Ryan Leaf could throw for 300 yards and a couple scores against the league\'s worst secondary, Tampa. Through 15 weeks, the ragtag Bucs have surrendered an almost inconceivable 322.5 passing yards and 1.9 vertical strikes per game, equal to 25.9 fantasy points per contest in standard leagues. Unheralded QBs Christian Ponder, Nick Foles and even the once revered but now ridiculed Philip Rivers, all posted banner numbers against them. With usher enemy Danny Amendola healthy and Chris Givens routinely burning DBs, odds are strong Bradford logs his second straight QB1-level line. If you\'re a concerned RGIII owner, live by one simple phrase in your title game, "Ram it!"'

S"Tinsel. Eggnog. Christmas songs about roasting nuts. DeAngelo domination. Yep, it definitely is December. Williams, who was an unstoppable force in the fantasy playoffs just four short years ago, is up to his old his butt-kicking devices. With Jonathan Stewart ailed by a bum ankle and Cam Newton flourishing, the overlooked veteran has posted RB2-worthy numbers in 12-team leagues, displaying vintage versatility and open-field explosiveness. Over the past two weeks, he's accounted for 5.9 yards per touch, 128 total yards per game and a pair of receiving touchdowns. And don't be overly alarmed by Mike Tolbert's cameo in Week 15. The rolling beer keg's 11 touches and two scores against ex-employer San Diego were season highs. Unquestionably, Williams will tote the heavy end of the load against Oakland. Inexplicably, Jamaal Charles touched the rock just 13 times last week against the Raiders. Unlike Romeo Crennel, who was obviously hindered by a case of excessive brain flatulence, Ron Rivera won't make the same mistake.  Against Oakland's horrific run defense, the Panthers' boss hogs should feed from the trough. Including last week's clamp down on KC, O-Town has yielded 4.5 yards per carry this season and the fifth-most fantasy points to RBs. Ten rushers have scored at least 12 fantasy points against it. Yes, Williams will surrender work inside the 10, but his home run hitting ability combined with Oakland's general unwillingness to tackle spell sizable totals for the veteran in Week 16."

S"If you would've predicted back in August Ballard was to lead all Vicks in fantasy scoring, I would've recommended you to seek medical attention.  Remarkably, that has been the case. Down Donald Brown, the rookie from Mississippi State has excelled in recent weeks, showered with compliments by Bruce Arians and the coaching staff. Two weeks ago after he clobbered the Titans for 94 yards on 19 carries, the interim head coach described the rookie as a 'poor man's Edgerrin James,' a 'bowlegged back' who is 'tough to bring down.' Rolling up an impressive 105 yards against Houston in Week 15, the young rusher has also earned admiration in the fantasy community. Over the past three weeks, he's routinely plowed over tacklers, netting a robust 5.2 yards per carry. Because of Andrew Luck's recent inconsistencies and Ballard's still fresh legs, he could be leaned on more over the final two weeks, particularly in KC. The Chiefs franchise, touched by tragedy and general ineptitude, is on the verge of being completely dismantled. From Scott Pioli down to Dwayne Bowe, it's highly unlikely many current members of the organization will wear red next year. Abysmal execution across the board is to blame. Though they've only allowed seven rushing touchdowns this season, KC has yielded nearly 4.6 yards per carry to RBs. Since Week 8 four running backs, including Darren McFadden in Week 15, have crossed the 100 total-yard mark against the Chiefs. Bank on Ballard adding to that total."

S"With his long-flowing hair, chiseled physique and handsome looks, a casual observer would probably guess Cooper worked as a 'Thunder from Down Under' dancer or Bod spokes-model. He, like Clay Mathews, is a football Fabio. The former Gator is also a solid red-zone weapon who's performed well filling the void for injured starer DeSean Jackson. His yardage totals haven't moved the meter over the past three weeks (29.3 yards per game), but he's splashed pay-dirt twice, attracting a healthy 7.0 targets per game. Nick Foles has shown flashes of future brilliance since overtaking the starter's role, but Philly's incompetent offensive line has done him few favors. If he receives adequate protection, he and Riley could become quite the combo this week against Washington. A disaster in pass defense, the 'Skins have been overly accommodating to opponents for much of the season. They've conceded the third-most fantasy points to WRs and rank fifth in the NFL in most pass plays of 20-plus yards allowed. Cooper's blend of size and speed should prove problematic for DeAngelo Hall and friends. Recall five weeks ago in Washington, he hauled in a season-best five catches for 61 yards. If you're in dire straits for a WR3, hang with Mr. Cooper."

S"Words cannot express the torment Alexander zealots suffered through against Carolina. Inexplicably, DX, who entered Week 15 as the third-best fantasy wideout since Week 10 ranking behind Calvin Johnson and Dez Bryant, churned out more round pastries than a Dunkin' Donuts at a police function. Targeted just three times, he was the unfortunate byproduct of an inept Chargers offensive line which placed Philip Rivers into several high-duress situations. Of the QB's 31 dropbacks, 13 (41.9-percent) were deemed 'under pressure' according to Pro Football Focus. That combined with the stellar play of the Carolina secondary explains why Alexander completely disappeared. Though an intimidating matchup is on the docket, don't expect another Houdini act. No doubt, Antonio Cromartie is an exceptional cover corner, but with Malcom Floyd working the opposite side of the field (UPDATE: Floyd has landed on I.R., a move that definitely clouds Alexander's worth in Week 16. In this day and age, it's rare CBs stick to one WR exclusively, but because Rivers has limited options, Cromartie is sure line up on DX's side several times. Take the news into consideration.), it's unlikely he'll shadow Alexander exclusively. In instances where undersized Kyle Wilson lines up against the 6-foot-5 skyscraper, Rivers will take advantage, especially inside the red-zone. Keep in mind Wilson has allowed a modest 56.0 catch percentage to his assignments this year, the 36th-best mark among eligible CBs. After last week's debacle, owners understandably have trust issues, but speaking as a fellow DX enthusiast, he will remain firmly planted in my starting lineup in Week 16."

S"Russell's rise is nothing short of extraordinary. RGIII and Andrew Luck may have written many headlines, but, in reality, Wilson might be the league's best rookie passer. At the very least, he deserves to be in the Offensive ROY conversation. What he's accomplished since Week 9 is unique for a first-year QB. Poised, polished and decisive, he's made one brainy decision after another, executing in high-leverage situations with the stoicism of a multi-time Pro Bowler. Over that six-game stretch, he's totaled 205.2 passing yards and 45.7 rushing yards per game while tallying a nearly flawless 14:1 td:int split (3 rush TDs). He, like Griffin, is one of the virtual game's premier dual scorers, an asset that can completely deconstruct opponents via ground and air. I've become rather smitten by him. In his first meeting against the Niners, Wilson logged undeniably the worst game of his young career, netting an embarrassing 133 combined yards and a pick. His 38.7 QB rating resembled a certain fantasy writer's I.Q. But that was nearly two months ago. Since then, he's matured into one of the league's most judicious passers. San Fran has surrendered just four multi-TD passers on the year and a mere 5.9 yards per attempt in its past five, but with division title hopes on the line, a captive national TV audience watching and the 12th-man rocking, Wilson will make his case for the hardware. Keep in mind, he's registered a 118.4 QB rating in six home starts this year."

S"What Stafford hasn't achieved this year is quite remarkable. Though he's only 62 passes shy of breaking Drew Bledsoe's single-season attempts record, he's tallied the same number of vertical scores as Jay Cutler (17) and one fewer than Sam Bradford. Plain bad luck is partially to blame for the shocking lack of TDs. Calvin Johnson has seemingly fallen short of the goal-line a half-dozen times. Injuries to Nate Burleson and Ryan Broyles coupled with Titus Young's temper tantrum didn't help, but the former No. 1 pick is far absolved from the production downturn. Poor decision-making and flawed mechanics have led to numerous misfires and turnovers inside the red-zone. Many receivers have been open near the end-zone, Stafford has, too often, missed them badly. Another rocky performance should be expected this week against Atlanta. Only Seattle has yielded fewer passing touchdowns than the Falcons this season (13). Since Week 5, Drew Brees and Cam Newton are the only signal callers to log multiple scores versus Asante Samuel and company. He'll be a quality bargain buy in drafts next year, but with greenbacks on the line, Stafford will lead you to bankruptcy if trusted."

S"Filled with more plot twists than a Tarantino bloodbath, Johnson's season has taken owners on quite the ride. His highs have been nothing short of spectacular. His lows, however, have left many deeply sullen. On paper, Green Bay would appear to be an ideal matchup. Since Week 10 only the Cardinals and Giants have surrendered more fantasy points to rushers. But Clay Matthews' return to action in Chicago last week greatly bolstered a unit in dire need. Matt Forte was effective in the pass game, but struggled to find creases between the tackles, finishing with a meager 69 yards on 20 carries. Chicago's offensive line is mostly to blame, but Matthews is a difference-maker. When he was on the field in Green Bay's first nine games, Frank Gore was the only rusher to surpass 100 rushing yards against the Pack. During that stretch, RB1s netted a marginal 4.0 yards per carry. Complicating matters, Tennessee's inadequacies on defense could place the Titans in a deep hole, curtailing Johnson's scoring opportunities. No doubt he looked great (On one run) against the Jets Monday night, but don't be surprised if his CJ2Lame alter-ego rears its ugly head at Lambeau."

The admiration is warranted. He's averaged a gaudy 7.1 yards per touch, tallying an insane 1,399 total yards on only 199 touches. Imagine for a minute what he could do with Arian Foster's workload. As great as Spiller is, a lackluster line could be on tap on South Beach. The Dolphins are one of the few defenses that made the explosive rusher work for his yards. Week 11 in Buffalo, he compiled a modest 4.1 yards per carry against them. Cameron Wake, who has accounted for 33 stops, tops among defensive ends, is one of the league's finest run defenders. He along with linebacker Kevin Burnett and defensive tackle Randy Starks explain why the 'Fins are quite formidable in the trenches. Spiller and Chris Johnson are the only two RBs that have eclipsed 100 total yards against them. Minus Fred Jackson, C.J. will get another 15-20 touches, but in the rematch, count on the home team to get the best of him."

S"The facial expression on Colston's face pretty much says it all. The once steady producer has become a true king of inconsistency. For those in standard formats, he's dropped several yule logs over the past four weeks, hitting pay-dirt just once while averaging an unexciting 57.0 yards per game. His unreliability shouldn't be overly surprising. In a spread-the-wealth system, erratic production is common, even for Jimmy Graham. Another vanilla effort could be on tap for the wideout this week. Dallas largely failed to ground the Steelers' pass game a week ago, giving up 339 passing yards and two scores to Ben Roethlisberger. But with Morris Claiborne expected to return to action after missing last week's game due to post-concussion effects, the Cowboys, on track to make the playoffs, should elevate their game against Drew Brees. Due to their strong safety play, WR1s have netted just 57.0 yards per game versus the 'Boys this year. Par for the course over the past few weeks, Colston will be more WR3 than WR1 material in Week 16."

S"From afar, Decker is a man that has it all -- fame, fortune, good looks, Peyton Manning, a rather busty significant other. We all would gladly accept eternal damnation to be in his shoes. However, his fantasy profile isn't indicative of his outward image. Yes, he's contributed soundly at times (e.g. last week at Baltimore), but in other instances he's vanished, leaving owners in the dumps. His unpredictable lull form Weeks 10-13 certainly left investors scratching their heads. Though he's riding a two-game upswing, the former Golden Gopher could bury supporters at the most inopportune time. The Browns boast arguably the league's most underrated secondary. Joe Haden and Sheldon Brown underwhelmed last week against Kirk Cousins, but, when on the field together, they've held many marquee receivers in check. Since Haden's return in Week 11, notable names Miles Austin, Pierre Garcon and Mike Wallace posted marginal numbers against the duo. Combined the DBs have surrendered a QB rating of just 76.1. And WR2s have averaged a mere 55.7 yards per game versus Cleveland on the year. Toss in Denver's renewed emphasis on the ground and the early blowout potential, and it's certainly possible Decker pulls a 'Danario' in Week 16."

S'The Peyton Manning comparisons to Luck are downright eery. Both are highly intelligent. Both exude leadership. Both were No. 1 picks. And both probably relish Papa John\'s pizza. Most remarkably, their NFL debuts were nearly identical (PM: 302-1-3, Luck: 309-1-3). Against Chicago, the rookie was, for the most part, uneven. At times, he exhibited superstar form, delivering passes crisply in the short-to-intermediate field. Other times, however, he pressed the issue, under-throwing balls that led to costly interceptions. But, as Reggie Wayne commented post-game, "Rome wasn\'t built in a day." Growing pains are par for the course for any inexperienced QB, even if his name is Robert Griffin III. In Luck\'s home debut, expect a more favorable outcome. Last week against Jacksonville, the Vikings made Blaine Gabbert look like vintage Mark Brunell, surrendering 260 yards and two touchdowns. Jared Allen could have a field day against an Indy frontline that yielded four sacks in Chicago, but when given time, look for Luck to dissect Minnesota\'s questionable Cover 2. Versus the Jags, Antoine Winfield allowed a catch rate of 66.7 percent. Meanwhile, fellow DB Chris Cook gave up a whopping 19.8 yards per catch \xe2\x80\x94 great news for Reggie Wayne and, if healthy, Austin Collie. Saddle up Luck in deeper leagues.'

S"In preseason play, the rusher was just somebody owners use to know. Spiller's tap-dancing style and uncomfortable number of negative plays buried him behind Fred Jackson on the depth-chart. However, after the incumbent exited stage left in New York due to a sprained knee, the backup resembled the explosive quicksilver that guided owners to championship glory late last year. His 56-yard TD scamper was a thing of beauty. He also forced a league-best eight missed tackles on just 16 total touches. Now with Jackson out for at least the next month, it's Spiller's time to shine. Look for him to again seize the moment. Kansas City, minus six starters on defense last week, is a team ravaged by injuries. Though it did a quality job bottling up Michael Turner in Week 1, don't bank on a repeat performance, with or without Tamba Hali. Buffalo, despite its shortcomings in the pass game, is capable of running the ball effectively. In terms of run-blocking, the offensive line is one of the AFC's best. Combine that with Spiller's fantastic versatility and likely 20-plus touches, and a top-five line is likely in order. Consider him must-start material in any sized league."

S"Riddle me this. Riddle me that. The Riddler's numbers will be phat. The ground centerpiece in New England's suddenly balanced attack, the second-year rusher was resplendent in Tennessee. Running behind a retooled Pats offensive line, he totaled 152 yards overall, racking up a ridiculous 82 yards after contact. New England hasn't had a top-12 fantasy producer at RB since the days of Corey Dillion, but Ridley could buck that trend. His powerful build and attacking style will continue to inflict plenty of damage between the tackles. Shane Vereen, once up to full speed, will likely supplant him on third downs, but the youngster has strong odds of splashing six on a consistent basis. The Pats will live inside the red-zone, especially this week. Arizona was highly active last week versus Seattle, limiting Marshawn Lynch to a bland 4.0 yards per carry. Darnell Docket, in particular, was outstanding. However, this is a team that hasn't fared well outside the UPS historically, especially when forced to travel east. When weighing the blowout potential and Bill Belichick's confidence in Ridley, the rusher is a slam-dunk RB2 in Week 2."

S"Throughout the draft season many owners and analysts, including yours truly, were gaga for Titus Young. His eye-popping plays in camp and glowing headlines prompted many to prop him up on a pedestal. Mr. Burleson, our apologies. Though overshadowed by the Young hype, old reliable remains Matthew Stafford's clear-cut No. 2. In a hard-fought win versus St. Louis, Burleson enticed eight targets, hauling in six receptions for 69 yards. No question traveling to San Francisco is an intimidating assignment. Last week in Green Bay, Carlos Rogers and company did a reasonably good job capping Aaron Rodgers. Still, however, they allowed a 71.4 catch rate. With so much attention drawn to Calvin Johnson's side and given the Niners' staunch linebacker corps, Burleson could become the weapon of choice in the Lions' pass game. His 'shadow,' Tarell Brown, was abused by the Pack, giving up over 20 yards per catch. Plug him in as a WR2/3 in 12-team and deeper formats."

S"In a league where versatility is cherished, Cobb is worth his weight in cheddar. Green Bay's answer to Percy Harvin lined up in the backfield 19 times and also saw ample action in the slot in his 2012 debut versus San Francisco. The results, for the PPR masses, were dreamy (9-77-0). He also chipped in a nifty 75-yard punt return for a TD. Because Cedric Benson's hands were forged from stone and Alex Green is still not up to speed, Mike McCarthy's has essentially designated Cobb as his third-down back, a strategy that will likely continue. Chicago, which runs Cover 2 almost exclusively, is a defense vulnerable underneath, indicative in the copious numbers Coby Fleener and Wayne racked in Week 1. Because McCarthy wants to create mismatches and given the uncertain availability of Greg Jennings, the underrated slot machine is slated to hit pay-dirt. Pull the lever on the WR3 even in shallow formats."

S'Just exactly who would complement budding star A.J. Green in Cincinnati was one of the exhibition season\'s greatest mysteries. A number of young, unexciting candidates were on the list, including third-round pick Mohamed Sanu, but it appears a former reality TV standout is the man for the job. Hawkins was one of the few highlights in Baltimore\'s declawing of the Bengals Monday night. The former Montreal Allouette and runner-up to Jesse Holley on "4th and Long" looked like a cross between Danny Amendola, Darren Sproles and a whippet. Targeted a team-high 11 times he snagged eight passes for 86 yards, exhibiting cartoon wheels (4.34 40-yard) and eye-catching elusiveness. Though he\'s no longer a secret, look for him to build on his initial effort. Cleveland executed well against Philadelphia in its opener, but the loss of Joe Haden to suspension in Week 2 will greatly hinder its performance in the encore. With coverage rotating to the side of Green, Hawkins could again thrive picking apart zone sets underneath. PPR owners in challenging formats need to say hello to this kitty.'

S"Badgered repeatedly last week against an average Browns defense, Vick was lucky he didn't leave C-Town folded up in a box. According to Pro Football Focus, 25 of his 61 dropbacks were under duress. Unsurprisingly, the added pressure caused him to make hasty throws, four of which connected with Cleveland defenders. Overall, he exhibited poor decision-making and Blaine Gabbert-like awareness. Vick, a little rusty after an extended layoff during the preseason, isn't completely to blame for his unsteady Week 1 performance. The Eagles offensive line couldn't protect the pocket from a group of handicapped sloths. Its dreadful execution better improve rapidly or the Philly pass game will again crumble. Baltimore absolutely declawed the Bengals Monday night, collapsing the pocket early and often. In total, Andy Dalton, blitzed 48.7 percent of the time, was a victim of four sacks. If the Eagles beef doesn't jell quickly it could be a long, frustrating afternoon for No. 7. In leagues where turnovers are heavily penalized, Vick is bench worthy in Week 2."

S"Those who gladly took on the risk and selected CJ2LAME in Round 1 are bleeding profusely. After posting 11 carries for four yards versus New England last Sunday, his supporters, convinced 2011 was an anomaly, fell on a collective sword. Embarrassingly, six of his touches went for zero or negative yards. Only his six receptions for 47 yards salvaged what was otherwise a disastrous season debut. And that was only in PPR leagues. It's the same old broken record for Johnson. The Titans offensive line, consumed whole by Vincent Wilfork, failed to sustain blocks. Meanwhile, the rusher, always swinging for the fences, didn't attack the line with much vigor, tapdancing in the backfield while looking for daylight. Outside of underneath coverage, the Chargers were very active at the point of attack versus Oakland. Darren McFadden was limited to a minuscule 2.1 yards per carry on 15 attempts. Considering Tennessee's run-blocking issues and the hostile environment, Johnson should ride the pine for owners with viable alternatives (e.g. C.J. Spiller)."

S"Channeling the football ghost of Brian Westbrook, McFadden was a PPR nightmare in Week 1. His 13 receptions was the second-best mark in franchise history (Tim Brown holds the record with 14). However, his overall performance in standard formats wasn't quite as stellar. Yes, he finished with a very respectable 118 total yards, but he failed to find the end-zone and, as mentioned above, posted  a ghastly YPC. Miami, once again, is a run defense to fear. Arian Foster notched a fine fantasy day last week, but, the 'Fins largely kept the Texans ground game, one of the league's best, in check. Foster and Ben Tate combined for only 2.7 yards per carry. Randy Starks, in particular, was an animal, responsible for four stops. Jared Odrick and Cameron Wake also weren't pushovers. Run DMC is a marvelous talent who can beat you in a variety of ways, but given the difficult matchup and question marks surrounding Oakland's offense as a whole, he could struggle on South Beach."

S'Smith\'s 2012 campaign started out with a "Bang!" On the Ravens\' first play from scrimmage Monday night versus Cincinnati, Joe Flacco uncorked a bomb, connecting with the wideout on an explosive 52-yard play. Unfortunately, Smith disappeared after that. He hauled in just one more catch for five yards. Another uneven effort could be in the offing. Yes, Brandon Weeden\'s 5.1 passer rating was nearly equal to the number of prom dates that rejected The Noise in high school, but much of the rookie\'s struggles were due to the exceptional play of Nnamdi Asomugha and Dominque Rodgers-Cromartie. The stifling corners combined for four pass deflections, conceding just two receptions (16.7 catch percentage). Flacco\'s soaring confidence in the no-huddle is a plus, but a road matchup against arguably the league\'s best secondary is daunting. Expect Smith to sour.'

S'Inconsistency continues to be the norm for Dez. A centerpiece of the Dallas attack in the first half against New York, he stayed in the shadows after halftime, grabbing just one pass in the third quarter. His final line (4-85-0) was laudable, but his low target yield (5) and Kevin Ogletree\'s emergence are a bit worrisome. In many ways, he\'s the new Vincent Jackson, a completely unreliable performer on a week-in, week-out basis. This week in Seattle, expect the seesaw to sink. Corners Richard Sherman and Brandon Browner are one dynamic duo. Week 1 in \'Zona, the pair did a masterful job keeping Larry Fitzgerald under wraps. Sure Tony Romo is light years better than John Skelton/Kevin Kolb, but considering the secondary\'s lock-down attitude, the \'Hawks\' raucous home crowd and Dez\'s vulnerability to vanishing, he is a highly suspect option in Week 2. As Jerry Jones admitted this week, the young wideout, "Has to get better at everything he does."'

S"Palmer is the Fuddruckers burger of the NFL \xe2\x80\x94 terribly underrated. Despite ranking ninth in total points among quarterbacks, well-ahead of brand names Cam Newton, Michael Vick and Tony Romo, his cheeks remain firmly planted on most virtual benches week-to-week. They shouldn't. If there's one passer who should be suffering from a 'tired arm,' it's the Raider. Thanks to Oakland's friendly defense, only Matthew Stafford (44.6) has attempted more passes than Palmer (41.4) this season. More of the same is on the docket in Week 11. Early indications suggest Darren McFadden could return to the lineup this week, but even if he does, a pass-first, pass-often blueprint will likely be followed. New Orleans, winners of four straight, are arguably the hottest offensive team in the league. Because the Raiders and Saints, defensively, would struggle to cage a herd of turtles, a shootout seems inevitable. That occurs, and Palmer could again flirt with the top-five. On average, 'Nawlins has given up a mind-blowing 27.6 fantasy points per game to QBs this year. Matt Cassel was the only passer \xe2\x80\x94 Shocker! \xe2\x80\x94 who didn't cross the 22-point threshold against it in standard formats. Enough is enough. Show it's time to plug Palmer in."

S"Every year it happens. A previously unheralded RB emerges from the woodworks, throws willing fantasy owners onto his back and carries them to championship glory. Back in the day, Nick Goings, Ron Dayne and Pierre Thomas proved to be late-season difference-makers. Now, it's Thomas' time. 'Backup' in name only, the emerging juggernaut has outperformed, outplayed and out-snapped (107-to-66) 'starter' Reggie Bush over the past three weeks, earning the confidence of Joe Philbin and the Miami coaching staff. Though he's only contributed modestly in the box score, he's expanded his role beyond that of goal-line gremlin. He's seen extensive action on early and even passing downs, developing into a viable dual-threat. Over the past two weeks, he's grabbed seven passes for 59 yards. Pound-for-pound Bush is the superior back, but his fumbling problems have him in the doghouse, evident in his early benching last week against Tennessee. Any Dolphins rusher past, present or future is start-worthy this week based on the matchup, but Thomas is the best option. Roughly 15-18 touches could be in order against the league's most giving defense, Buffalo. In total, 12 RBs have reached 'Flame' status against the Bills this season, the most in the league. Overall, rushers are averaging 5.1 yards per carry against them. In what could be a break out game for Thomas, trust him as a RB2 in 12-team and deeper leagues."

S'Seemingly on the back burner after Jonathan Dwyer and Isaac Redman filled the void brilliantly over the past three weeks, Mendenhall, recovering from an Achilles injury, is on the brink of retaking the starting job. Steelers running backs coach Kirby Wilson revealed last week the former All-Pro, when healthy, is "the lead dog, our top runner...He is the guy who can take a 10-yard run and make people miss and get 20 more." Similar to how Redman and Dwyer were employed Monday against KC, a hot hand approach will likely be implemented. Still, based on Wilson\'s words, Mendenhall should again sit in the captain\'s chair this week against Baltimore. No longer the iron wall of yesteryear, the Ravens defense, sans its heart and soul, Ray Lewis, is nonintimidating. The Steelers offensive line, which has improved greatly of late, could run roughshod over the Ravens front. Over the past five weeks, Baltimore has surrendered an uncharacteristic 4.7 yards per carry, 171.1 total yards per game and three scores to RBs, equal to the fourth-most fantasy points. Practice reports will need to be closely monitored, but if Mendenhall isn\'t limited this week, he deserves to be reinserted immediately. Though he will be occasionally spelled by Dwyer/Redman and Ben Roethlisberger\'s questionable availability is a concern, he should produce RB2 level numbers on 14-17 touches. If active in Week 11, turn the Steel wheel.'

S"For the PPR massess, the unheralded Roberts has offered a fair amount of WR3 consistency. Despite logging nearly 30 fewer targets than revered teammate Larry Fitzgerald, he has bested the multi-time All-Pro in standard league points per game 9.5 to 9.2. With militaristic precision, the Citadel product has developed into one of the league's finest route-runners, particularly on underneath patterns. Not surprisingly, he's recorded two seven-catch games in his past three. Another delectable PPR line could be on the menu this week in Atlanta. The Falcons have held most receivers in check this season. Only four have crossed the 10-point threshold against them this year. But with Asante Samuel likely to shadow Fitzgerald, Roberts could prove destructive. His likely escort, Dunta Robinson, has given up a 70.9 catch percentage to his assignments. Add that to the strong likelihood Arizona will be playing from behind for much of the game, and it's probable another double-digit workload is in the offing for the No. 2. Slot him in at WR3 in 12-team and deeper leagues."

S"Last week another Rams castoff, Danario Alexander, was mentioned in this space. This time around, it's Avery's turn to Flame. Against the Jags in Week 11, he erased concerns about his tender hip grabbing a serviceable four receptions for 65 yards on six targets, his fifth-straight game with at least four catches. Ageless wonder Reggie Wayne is the clearly the apple of Andrew Luck's eye, but any and all Colts receivers are viable starts this week against the Patriots. Downfield coverage continues to plague New England. On the season, no team has surrendered more pass plays of 20-plus yards. Starting corners Devin McCourty and Kyle Arrington have allowed a combined 15.5 yards per catch. Avery, a slippery target with explosive speed, is the perfect weapon to take advantage of the Pats' inefficiencies. In what should be another high-volume affair for Luck, look for the wideout to notch WR2-level totals."

S'Alongside bartenders, local celebrities and Girl Scout troops, backup quarterbacks are well-liked in NFL towns where turmoil is ever-present. Foles is no exception. When a freshly concussed Michael Vick slowly moseyed to the locker-room Sunday, Eagles fans, ever the frigid faithful, erupted in jubilation. Finally, the much-discussed rookie, thought to be the solution to their woes, was gifted his shot. Though Foles didn\'t write a "Rudy"-esque happy ending, he did exude sizable potential during his 2.5 quarters of action against an unforgiving Dallas secondary. He exhibited a strong, fairly accurate downfield arm, quick release and surprising mobility, especially on a 44-yard TD connection with Jeremy Maclin. Occasional turbulence is likely with the youngster, but the environment is quite nourishing. With LeSean McCoy, DeSean Jackson, Brent Celek and Maclin as targets, the arsenal is fully stocked. The pass-heavy system is also a major plus. Don\'t think for a second Andy Reid will follow a conservative game-plan. Much like Kevin Kolb before him, Foles will be counted on to conduct the West Coast offense as normal. Philly\'s horrific offensive line is a problem, but, unlike Vick, the youngster has shown he can get rid of the ball in a hurry. It would be no shock with a full week of first-team reps, he flourishes in his first start. After all, the matchup is awfully attractive. The worst fantasy performance Washington has allowed this season was to Josh Freeman in Week 4. And he registered 19.8 points (299-1-1-8) in standard formats. If Sam Bradford and Christian Ponder can exceed 20-points against the \'Skins, so can Foles. Assuming Vick\'s \'pretty significant concussion\' keeps him sidelined, expect the rook to log a top-15 line in Week 11.'

S"Outside his 155-total yard, 1-TD thrashing of New Orleans in Week 8, the elderly rusher has started to develop a noticeable crust. Against San Diego, Cincinnati and exploitable Carolina, he totaled a mere 3.2 yards per carry, 85.6 total yards per game and accounted for zero touchdowns. Considering his advanced age, slumping production and troublesome case of fumblitis \xe2\x80\x94 he's lost four of five fumbles this year \xe2\x80\x94 one has to wonder if McGahee's fantasy value is abruptly grinding to a halt. Still, he has the faith of the coaching staff and continues to dominate snaps over rookie backup Ronnie Hillman. However, if another ball squirts free from his grasp, the tables could definitely turn. Four weeks ago in his first meeting against the Chargers, the rusher proved useful tallying 98 yards on 21 touches. Provided he squeezes the rock, another 18-22 touches are on tap in the rematch, but spectacular numbers could be farfetched. Since Week 6, Trent Richardson is the only RB to rack at least 12 fantasy points against the Bolts. And on the season they've allowed a very modest 3.7 yards per carry to RBs. Because of the sizable workload, McGahee remains a suitable RB2 in a hellish bye week for backs, but don't bank on Mile High numbers."

S"Admittedly, the Model T, who at times has resembled the antiquated vehicle his nickname implies, has occasionally revved his engine like a Mustang, indicative in his surprising 20-102-1 spanking of Dallas two weeks ago. But those occurrences have been rare. His yards per carry, eerily similar to this time last year, is again on the downward swing. Over the past five weeks he's netted a measly 3.1 yards per carry, punctuated by a humiliating 13 carries for 15 yards against the NFC's worst run defense, New Orleans, last week. Apparent in his absent burst and constant goal-line stuffs versus the Saints, he's a rusher who would have difficulties penetrating a wall of Jell-O. Expect him to again plod in the follow-up. Arizona's defense historically performs best at home, but this season they've flipped the script. With Adrian Peterson the lone exception, hosting running backs have struggled against Darnell Docket and company averaging just 66.7 rushing yards per game. If Turner again stumbles out of the blocks, look for younger, more explosive complements Jacquizz Rodgers and Jason Snelling to wrest away touches. Unless he does backstrokes in the Fountain of Youth, his role will almost certainly erode further as the season progresses. Keep in mind since Week 8 he's seen just 48.8 percent of snaps. Put him in park."

S"No player suffered more from the Week 10 quarterback carnage than Marshall. Jay Cutler, doubtful for Monday's pivotal conference clash with San Francisco, and the wideout have been nearly inseparable this season. Marshall, whose smile hasn't left his face since he was first introduced at Halas Hall back in March, is on pace to obliterate career highs in receptions (119 pace), receiving yards (1,606) and touchdowns (12). Unfortunately, with his bosom buddy down and out, Marshall's super-elite status is in jeopardy. Jason Campbell, who's started 70 games in his career, is a serviceable backup, but his suspect chemistry with the first team and constant urge to check-down raises red flags. So does this week's matchup. For WRs, San Francisco treats have been few and far between. On the year, only James Jones and Danny Amendola have finished inside the top-24 against the Niners. Carlos Rogers' coverage, in particular, has been outstanding. His assignments, usually WR1s, have averaged a lowly 8.3 yards per catch. Marshall should again attract eight-plus targets, but unless Alshon Jeffery's return helps reduce pressure on the top dog, he will likely remain caged."

S"If Mick Jagger bought the farm tomorrow, Rollins Stones fans would feel the same pain Steelers Nation is currently experiencing. The loss of franchise frontman, Ben Roethlisberger, is a 'Doom and Gloom' scenario for the AFC contender. Cold, wet conditions were a factor Monday night, but without No. 7 on the field, the Steelers' offense sputtered under the guidance of backup Byron Leftwich. A full week of work as the starter should help the ex-Jag shake off the cobwebs, but in a critical division game against Baltimore, defense, as usual, will likely dominate. Most expected the Ravens secondary to crumble after Ladarius Webb shredded his knee four weeks ago. But, no surprise, Revolutionary War hero Ed Reed hasn't allowed that to happen. Incredibly, the future HOFer has yielded a 37.5 QB rating on the year. After a marginal Week 11 (3-14-1), another joker is likely in the cards for the erratic Wallace. Keep in mind, even with Big Ben on the field, the king of inconsistency has notched lame-worthy numbers five times in nine games. Given the circumstances, Morley Safer is more reliable than Pittsburgh's '60 Minutes' this week."

S"Witten, similar to seasonal change, high gas prices and Jerry Jones support for Tony Romo, is consistent. On pace to top 75 catches and 900 yards for the sixth consecutive season, he is the object of reliability in PPR leagues. What you see is what you get. Though failures are rare for Witten, particularly in the Lames format, he could lay an unexpected egg this week against Cleveland. Generally speaking, the Browns are a sieve defensively. They rank inside the top-10 in most fantasy points allowed to QBs, RBs and WRs. But, surprisingly, the Chihuahuas have blanketed TEs effectively this year. On average, they've conceded just 5.2 points per game to oversized targets, the third-fewest in the league. And, no, they haven't faced a bunch of Kellen Davises. Notable names Brent Celek, Jermaine Gresham, Scott Chandler, Martellus Bennett and Antonio Gates all underperformed against them. Credit linebackers D'Qwell Jackson and Kaluka Maiava. Both rate well-above average versus the pass according to Pro Football Focus. Witten has played out of his mind of late, but this week the visiting dogs sink their teeth."

S'The much maligned Kolb, designated the "Suckiest QB in the League" by yours truly after Blaine Gabbert looked semi-competent in Week 1, hasn\'t exactly lived down to his rather disparaging handle. In actuality, he\'s performed exceedingly well after seizing the starting reigns from gimpy John Skelton two weeks ago. Over two-plus games, he\'s played interception-free football, scoring five touchdowns (4 pass, 1 rush) while completing 64.4 percent of his attempts. To ensure Kolb\'s success, Ken Whisenhunt and company have tailored the playbook to the QB\'s strengths. Knowing his issues with passes beyond 20-yards, the staff has installed more plays indicative of a West Coast scheme, short hooks, shallow crosses and quick slants familiar to Kolb during his days in Philly. So far it\'s worked. Expect that trend to continue this week against Miami. The Fins\' back-end has been problematic this year for Joe Philbin. Corners Sean Smith and Richard Marshall have performed marginally at best. Through three weeks, the tandem has allowed a YPA of 7.6 and consecutive 300-yard passing games (To Carson Palmer and Mark Sanchez). With Kolb\'s confidence sky-high and Larry Fitzgerald finally back on track, a useful Week 4 tally is in the offing.'

S"It's official. Jackson possesses the regeneration power of the Incredible Hulk. According to the rusher, he's '70-75 percent' sure he will retake the field this week against New England. Chan Gailey, astonished by the rusher's rapid recovery, is also optimistic his starter will return to practice by Thursday at the latest. Assuming he doesn't trip over any speed-bumps, the plowshare is highly employable in Week 4. The NFL's third-leading rusher, C.J. Spiller, is likely to miss this week's contest with a shoulder strain. And although he filled in admirably last week, third-stringer Tashard Choice will assuredly take a backseat to the hungry incumbent. The Pats, led by buffet closer Vincent Wilfork, have defended the run stiffly thus far, conceding just 3.1 yards per carry to RBs. But pounded between the tackles by Ray Rice last week, they are hardly impenetrable. The Bills offensive line, one of the league's best in terms of run-blocking, should control the line of scrimmage. Jackson's history against New England also bodes well. In eight career contests versus the Pats, he's averaged 5.0 yards per carry. Ready to prove he's not ready to relinquish the starting job to Spiller, he should be counted on as a RB2 in 10-team and deeper leagues . After all, motivation is a very influential fantasy fueler."

S"Entering the season, many within the fantasy community believed Mr. 3.0 YPC would emit a rather putrid, Limburger cheese odor. But the rusher's first three weeks, though rather bland, haven't smelled like unwashed feet. In spurts, he's looked terrific. He's displayed surprising versatility, tackle-breaking power and plus vision, a key trait in Green Bay's zone-blocking scheme. His double-digit effort in the Seattle screwing, though modest in total yards (63-4-1), was laudable. After Monday's shipwreck at CenturyLink, Aaron Rodgers will undoubtedly unleash hell on New Orleans (Believe me, the Devil would be kinder), which should thrust Benson into many goal-to-go situations. An end-zone dive or three could be on the horizon. The Saints, thumped by the JC of KC in Week 3, have allowed a whopping 215.3 total yards per game, six touchdowns and 4.8 yards per carry to rushers this year. Given the unusual circumstances and juicy matchup, it would be no shock if Benson finished inside the RB top-5 this week. Start him with the utmost confidence."

S'For most rookie wide receivers not named T.Y. Hilton, the adage "Rome wasn\'t built in a day" applies. Most often it can take weeks, months or even years for targets to fully transition into the league, no matter how talented. Even Calvin Johnson took his lumps in his rookie season. Blackmon could follow a similar path. Nonexistent over the first three weeks, the first-round pick has barely registered a blip on the fantasy radar. As a result, he\'s been mass-dropped, even in competitive formats. Mike Mularkey attributes his struggles to poor routes and a pressing attitude. Still, he leads all Jags receivers in snaps (Blackmon - 164, Robinson - 122). Inevitably, he\'ll arrive. He\'s simply too gifted not to. If there was ever a week for Blackmon to make a splash, this is it. The Jags host Cincinnati, a defense reeling in all facets. Down Dre Kirkpatrick until the end of October and, possibly, Leon Hall (calf) again this week, the already vulnerable Bengals secondary is even more exploitable. Combined Nate Clements and Terrance Newman have surrendered a 68.0 catch percentage through three games. In the Battle of the Cats, look for the rookie to pack some thunder.'

S"Hampered by nagging injuries over the past couple seasons, the now healthy oversized target has regained respectability among deep leaguers. Through three weeks he's quietly attracted 22 targets, the seventh-most among TEs, hauling in 13 receptions for 160 yards and a touchdown. His subsequent 7.3 per game average in standard formats ranks ahead of roster mainstays Brandon Pettigrew, Jermichael Finley and Jermaine Gresham. Expect his standing to rise come Sunday. Suffice it to say, the Titans are allergic to defending tight ends. Thus far, they've allowed a staggering 19.8 fantasy points per game to TEs, the highest amount in virtual pigskin. Even Dante Rosario torched them for three scores in Week 2. Given Tennessee's shortcomings against the run, Arian Foster and Ben Tate should dominate touches, but when forced skyward look for Matt Schaub to lock in on No. 81."

S"Inactive the first two weeks of the season due to physical and mental limitations, Denver's diminutive spark-plug, who logged his first action of the season last week against Houston, is on the verge of becoming a household fantasy name. Starter Willis McGahee, highly questionable after suffering a rib injury in the third quarter last Sunday, has strong odds of sitting this week. If he's unable to go, a committee of unknown distribution will likely be installed. Because Knowshon Moreno and Lance Ball are about as exciting as eating tofu, the more flavorful Hillman has a shot to head up the platoon, provided he can protect Peyton Manning. The San Diego St. product is a dynamic, slashing runner with plus acceleration and tender hands, a Darren Sproles-type. If gifted an opportunity, he will pay instant dividends. Oakland, which hasn't defended the flat particularly well, has given up the second-most receptions to RBs on the young year. The Raiders have also allowed 4.2 yards per carry and 161.3 total yards per game to rushers. Add it up, and those hard-pressed for options at the FLEX should roll the dice on the rookie. (If no McGahee)"

S"If you ask Steve Smith, Cam couldn't lead a starving pack of 350-pound linemen to an all-you-can-eat nacho bar. His sulking attitude when faced with a large deficit last week was a prime example. Instead of encouraging his teammates to keep fighting, he waived the white flag, sitting on the bench hiding under a towel. A similar scenario could unfold this week. Atlanta, which lost arguably its best pass defender, Brent Grimes, Week 1, has fought through adversity. Over the past two weeks the Falcons secondary bewildered Peyton Manning and Philip Rivers, allowing just one touchdown while forcing five interceptions. Former Eagle Asante Samuel has championed the cause, limiting assignments to just 10.1 yards per catch, the eighth-best mark among corners with at least 200 snaps. Though Cam's completion percentage is up by nearly four percent compared to last year, he's made several erroneous decisions which have led to a number of costly turnovers. He's on pace to throw nearly 10 more picks compared to his rookie season. Last year, his rushing stats bailed him out of an otherwise dreadful performance at the Georgia Dome (237-0-3, 47-1). This year, however, the 'fearless' leader won't be so lucky. If you have viable alternatives, can Cam."

S"Starting Murray, who runs behind an offensive line that finds run-blocking challenging, against one of the league's stingiest defenses is about as appealing as being the meat in a sumo wrestler love sandwich. Through three games, the Bears have sniffed out the run effectively. Donald Brown, Cedric Benson and Steven Jackson averaged a combined 3.9 yards per carry and 66.0 total yards against the Monsters of the Midway. At times, Murray has displayed the explosiveness and versatility of a uniquely gifted rusher. Other times, as Rick Gosselin of the Dallas Morning News recently noted, he's bogged down in the backfield, indicative in his seven carries for negative yards last week versus Tampa. As a result, he's currently the 34th-best rusher, one spot behind derailed tank Peyton Hillis, in overall run performance according to Pro Football Focus. Because of Chicago's assertiveness in the trenches and Murray's susceptibility to backpedaling, it doesn't bode well for a standout effort. At best, he's a midrange RB2 in 12-team and deeper leagues this week."

S'T-Pain has made it very clear, he\'s not afraid of "Uncle Ray." But this isn\'t your run-of-the-mill creepy Uncle who sits around in his skivvies all day munching on Pizza Hut personal death vehicles while watching animals copulate on Nat Geo Wild. No, the Ravens\' \'Uncle,\' Ray Lewis, is a multi-time Pro Bowler and future first ballot Hall of Famer who is still executing at a high level. And for that reason, the rookie should be shivering in his cleats. Baltimore, no surprise, is an elite run defense, especially at home. Over its past 10 games at M&T, visiting rushers averaged just 3.5 yards per carry. Richardson is a punishing runner who also contributes handsomely in the pass game, but the Browns\' bland offensive line hasn\'t opened holes with much consistency. Against Philly and Buffalo, for example, Richardson netted a lowly 2.2 yards per carry. Another voluminous week is on tap for T-Pain, but given the extremely difficult matchup and run-blocking concerns he should only be stomached in 12-team and deeper formats. A lackluster high-carry, low-yardage yield is on tap.'

S'At first glance a matchup against a banged up Giants secondary that\'s occasionally struggled defending passes beyond 20 yards would be very appealing, especially for a speedster like Jackson. But, as Admiral Ackbar would say, "It\'s a trap!" The return of Prince Amukamara to New York\'s defensive backfield greatly bolstered a unit in need. His stellar play last week in Carolina was exactly what the doctor ordered (25.0 catch% allowed). Jackson, motivated to prove he still belongs among the league\'s elite playmakers, has improved his overall level of play this year. He ranks in the top-20 league-wide in receiving yards and yards per catch (16.7). Still, the matchup is far from encouraging. The Giants front seven are an aggressive bunch that should gash Philly\'s porous offensive line. That happens, and Michael Vick, as usual, will be running for his life, hindering opportunities downfield to Jackson. Add that to Jeremy Maclin\'s expected return, and chances are, the wideout could vanish for long stretches. Consider him a WR3 in deeper formats this week.'

S"Those wondering why New Orleans is winless through three weeks should look no further than what little Colston has accomplished. In the Saints' past four losses stretching back to last year, the wideout failed to eclipse 75-yards receiving. Typically, when he's been heavily involved in the pass game, 'Nawlins has thrived. His slow start can be primarily attributed to a nagging foot injury. But another explanation for his lack of production stems from the uneven play of the New Orleans offense as a whole. Drew Brees, under intense heat from opposing pass rushers, has thrown under duress 36.8-percent of the time, not a far cry from what Michael Vick and Jay Cutler have experienced this season. That intense pressure added to Colston's physical limitations and the Saints' spread-the-love nature are why he's made a minimal impact. This week, Sam Shields could be another reason. The 13th-best cover-man currently in the game per Pro Football Focus, he's surrendered a catch rate of just 40-percent this season. Though points should be aplenty in Lambeau this week, Colston, yet again, is poised to underachieve."

S'Once the Bea Arthur of fantasy quarterbacks, San Fran\'s \'Golden Girl\' is now more Blanche Devereaux \xe2\x80\x94 sassy, sultry and, statistically speaking, quite alluring. Coming off just his second 300-yard game since October 5, 2010, Smith is dealing. The antithesis of Mark Sanchez, he\'s completed nearly 69-percent of his passes and is on pace to obliterate his previous career high in touchdown passes (Pace: 26, High: 18). Consistency in coordinators has made him more comfortable with the offense and in his overall decision-making. His swollen \'bird\' is a "concern" to head coach Jim Harbaugh, but the signal caller downplayed the injury Monday calling it "no big deal." Assuming the swelling subsides, he\'s a fabulous start in Week 6. The visiting Giants are one of the league\'s worst pass defenses. According to Pro Football Focus, Corey Webster ranks No. 102 out of 102 corners  in pass coverage. Overall, the Giving-Men have surrendered 8.8 yards per attempt and four 20-point fantasy performances to QBs this season. For Drew Brees and Cam Newton owners seeking a one-week replacement, the Gold Panner should yield bountiful riches. Plug. Play. Reap.'

S'Similar to the other members of the \'Knee Three\' (Adrian Peterson and Jamaal Charles), Mendenhall didn\'t skip a beat in his triumphant return to the lineup. He resembled the hard-cutting, explosive back from two years ago, a season in which he finished No. 7 among RBs. After four weeks of Isaac Redman and Jonathan Dwyer 2-yard plods, it had to be refreshing for Steelers fans to see. Overall, he finished with 101 total yards and a touchdown on 16 touches against Philly. Thursday\'s encore could be even better, provided Pittsburgh\'s retooled offensive line continues to execute. Though Mike Munchak recently made a dumbfounding remark this year\'s Titans team is more talented than last year\'s mediocre bunch, his defense remains leaky, particularly in the trenches. Tennessee has conceded 4.2 yards per carry, 173.6 total yards per game and six touchdowns to rushers, equal to the sixth-most fantasy points allowed to RBs. Emerging from his inaugural effort of 2012 unscathed, the Steelers\' "savior" will carry supporters to the Promised Land. Start him with the utmost confidence, but, as Gerry Dulac reported Tuesday, don\'t expect a burdensome workload just yet.'

S"Brown offers about as much excitement as watching David Blaine get jolted for three straight days. Painfully average across the board, he's the consummate get-what-you-pay-for back. His skill set and overall workload rarely stand out. And Indy's inadequate defense has done him no favors. Still, when given opportunities he's contributed some meaningful stats. Nearly 66-percent of his 239 total rushing yards have come after contact. Fresh off his best game of the season, (92 total yards vs. GB) he's a RB2 to trust in Week 6. Because of Andrew Luck's rapid ascension and Reggie Wayne's otherworldly play, defenses are starting to turn their attention to the pass game, which should place Brown in several exploitable situations. The Puddle Jumpers, widely believed to be one of the league's stingiest run defenses entering the season, have been just the opposite. In particular, nose tackle Kenrick Ellis, who checks in at No. 46 per Pro Football Focus versus the run, has really struggled. Through five weeks, New York has allowed an uncharacteristic 4.7 yards per carry and the fourth-most fantasy points to RBs. On possibly his first 20 touch game of the season, Brown clowns Rex Ryan and company. (UPDATE: Brown underwent a knee scope Wednesday morning and is expected to miss 2-3 weeks. Ballard, who at times was a tackle-shredding beast in preseason play, will handle the load. Consider the promoted backup a mid-range RB2 in 12-team leagues this week.)"

In reality, it's a matchup to avoid, but, in fantasy, it's one to take advantage of. After losing Brent Grimes Week 1, most expected the Falcons' secondary to flounder. However, Asante Samuel has picked up the slack, executing brilliantly over the past few weeks. On the year, his assignments have netted just 9.6 yards per catch. And, overall, Atlanta has given up a mere 7.0 yards per passing attempt. But, despite the unsavory paper matchup, Moore is a trustworthy WR3 in 12-team and deeper leagues this week. Why? Oakland's defense is positively ghastly. Because a one-armed man could throw for 300 yards against the Raiders' secondary, Carson Palmer will likely accumulate 45-50 pass attempts, enhancing Moore's chances for a big payday. The wideout, who has averaged 8.7 targets in three games, could net his heftiest workload of the season."

S"Roberts, quietly in the midst of a breakout season, continues to draw minimal praise from the fantasy community. Owned in just over half of Yahoo! leagues, he deserves more. His 10.5 per game average in standard formats ranks No. 19 among WRs, ahead of notable names Eric Decker, Antonio Brown and teammate Larry Fitzgerald. Roberts put in the grunt work this offseason training alongside Fitz while devoting endless hours in the film room. As a result, he's become one of the game's most underrated route runners and underneath weapons. With so much attention paid to Fitzgerald, he's thrived in single coverage. Expect that trend to continue this week. No defense has yielded more wide receiver touchdowns (10) than the bumbling Bills. Starting corners Aaron Williams and Justin Rogers, who combined have allowed a 62.5 catch percentage, rank No. 91 and 97, respectively, in pass coverage according to PFF. If, and that's a giant IF, Kevin Kolb is afforded time, Roberts should flirt with triple-digits in yardage."

S"With Cedric Benson sidelined potentially for the next eight weeks with a Lisfranc injury, indications suggest James Starks will draw the start this week for Green Bay. But considering Starks' snaillike pace and inelastic running style, Green is the smart money bet. The ex-Hawaii star opened eyes last week in relief of Benson. His beautiful 41-yard scamper in the second half, a run which featured a brilliant cut-back across the grain, showcased his talents. Blessed with size (6-0, 225 lbs.), speed (4.45 40-yard time), versatility and a 'get downhill' mentality, he's a wonderful fit for Green Bay's zone-blocking scheme. However, the Packers' coaching staff, likely still worried about his surgically repaired knee, apparently don't want to overexert the young back. Still, even if he plays second-fiddle to Starks, he possesses plenty of flex appeal this week at Houston. The Texans, thought to be one of the league's most unyielding run defenses, has surrendered a generous 4.3 yards per carry to RBs this season. Shifty runners like Reggie Bush and Chris Johnson have caused them fits. And down one of its best gap defenders, Brian Cushing, Houston's vulnerability between-the-tackles is noticeable. If he logs 12-15 touches, Green could be one of Week 6's biggest surprises."

S'Tom Terrific? More like Tom Tepid in Seattle. Prior to Week 1, most projected extraordinary production for the two-time MVP this season. Everything was in place. He was a proven commodity surrounded with endless weapons in a pass-heavy system. But Bill Belichick isn\'t predictable. Shockingly, the Hoodie has called \'pass\' just 47.5-percent of the time through five games. Stevan Ridley, and not Brady, has become the engine that drives the offense. Still, the passer hasn\'t become a fantasy slouch. He currently ranks No. 7 among signal callers in per game average. This week, however, look for him to rank well outside the top-10. CenturyLink Field is an intimidating environment. Brady admitted earlier this week running no-huddle, which was instrumental in New England\'s win over Denver, in such a raucous venue "will be a challenge." Tony Romo and Aaron Rodgers, who both struggled earlier this year in Seattle, would most certainly agree. Overall, the \'Hawks have conceded just 6.0 yards per attempt and the fewest fantasy points to QBs. The defensive line along with blanketing corners Brandon Browner and Richard Sherman are a well-oiled machine. It may sound absurd, but Brady is bench worthy for owners with viable alternatives.'

S"When drafted four years ago, no one could've predicted the rusher, 199 pounds soaking wet, was capable of transforming from timeshare back to 30-carry Clydesdale, but that's exactly what he's become. Ridden repeatedly with Peyton Hillis sidelined by a high ankle sprain, the JC of KC has gripped the pigskin an average of 30.7 touches per game over the past three weeks, netting 6.1 yards per touch. Considering his lengthy recovery from a torn ACL, his resurgence is nothing short of remarkable. The workload is very attractive, but Charles, like any rusher, isn't immune from fantasy failure. This week's matchup is tougher than you think. A year ago, Stephen Hawking could've putted his way to 150 yards and a touchdown against the Bucs. In complete disarray under Raheem Morris, they ranked dead last versus the run. But new head honcho, Greg Schiano, has changed the culture, elevating the club's defensive profile. In particular, Gerald McCoy, who is the fourth-best run defender in the league according to Pro Football Focus, has ramped up his game. Strength versus strength will be the theme by the Bay this Sunday. At home, Tampa has surrendered just 3.5 yards per carry to RBs this year. But unless Brady Quinn, who floundered in 12 previous career starts, performs semi-competently, Charles could disappoint."

S"McGahee's birth may have preceded the construction of Stonehenge, but the ageless wonder has staved off Father Time, displaying nimble feet, versatility and burst reminiscent of his pre-injury days with the Bills. He's averaged 4.5 yards per carry and is on pace for a 1,204 rushing yard, 10-TD campaign. If he continues on that track it would be his finest fantasy season since 2004. Despite him losing a critical fumble last week against New England, Peyton Manning and cohorts remain committed to getting McGahee the ball in multiple situations. However, the Bolts are a stiff adversary. Corey Liuget and Shaun Phillips have done an excellent job sniffing out the run. As a whole, San Diego has yet to allow a 100-yard rusher this year and has limited opposing rushers to a modest 3.8 yards per carry. In a pivotal intradivisional game, McGahee may get jolted."

S"The newest spokesperson for the Wisconsin Department of Tourism isn't exactly luring travelers. His underwhelming performance on the field is bad for business in reality and fantasy. With or without Greg Jennings in uniform, Nelson, no longer a secret, has folded under added pressure. Only once this season has he reached double digits in fantasy scoring. And that was against the New Orleans Aints. On a per game basis teammates James Jones and Randall Cobb have outperformed him. Still, he's enticed a healthy 7.2 targets per game, but with only one TD on the season, some owners are strongly considering keeping their pair of Jordache in the closet, especially this week. Jonathan Joseph and Kareem Jackson are a defensive tandem to fear. According to Pro Football Focus, both rank inside the top-25 in pass coverage among cornerbacks. Their stellar play combined with J.J. Watt's disruptive nature at line  are major concerns for Jordy. Unless Green Bay recently signed a group of ogres to protect the pocket, Aaron Rodgers will likely be under duress early and often, limiting Nelson targets downfield."

S'Two weeks ago the Barracuda devoured everything in his path accomplishing what Mark Duper and Mark Clayton never did in their illustrious careers. His 253 yards against Arizona set a new franchise record, at the time a "bittersweet" accolade for the humble receiver. No surprise Hartline crashed back down to earth last week in Cincinnati. Attracting extra attention on numerous occasions, he caught just four passes for 59 yards on five targets. Another vanilla effort could be on tap versus visiting St. Louis. The Rams, no longer \'rancid\' defensively, have locked down the pass fairly consistently. Corners Bradley Fletcher and Janoris Jenkins combined have surrendered a mere 10.7 yards per catch to their assignments. Throw in St. Louis\' aggressive pass rush, and Hartline is more deep league WR3 than 12-team WR2 material in Week 6.'

S'This season, Rivers\' waters have been quite muddy. Already equipped with a throwing motion akin to a prepubescent girl, his mechanics look as disgusting as ever. So does his decision-making. Similar to last year, he\'s trying to thread balls through pin-holes, an obvious exercise in futility. His humiliating six turnover meltdown in the disaster versus Denver, an underperformance he blamed on "poor throws," was a prime example. Though he\'s on pace to set a new career high in completion percentage (66.5), his dipping YPA (\'11: 7.9, \'12: 7.1) and subsequent nosedive in YPG (289.0, 248.7) are very disconcerting. The primary reason for the drop-off stems from substandard protection. Rivers has been placed under duress on 37.3-percent of his attempts, resulting in a 42.1 QB rating in pressure packed situations. Despite the concerns, Cleveland is an adversary worth taking advantage of. Even with Joe Haden back in uniform, the Browns are a favorable opponent. Signal callers have scored at least two touchdowns in every game against the Chihuahuas this year. They\'ve also allowed 289.2 passing yards per game. Fresh off the bye, Rivers will showcase vintage form. Start him with confidence.'

S'Sift through the Roto Arcade archives and chances are you\'ll stumble across thousands of hyperbolic words about Jennings, authored by some loudmouthed buffoon with a plunging hairline. Yes, my infatuation for the backup is well-known. His three-down skill set, plus power and intimidating size have always seduced me. Now in the pole position with MJD out for "an extended period" due to a sprained arch, my feelings for the rusher, best expressed through song, are again a threat to most individuals\' comfort level. Yes, his 2.1 yards per carry last week in Oakland didn\'t light the world on fire, but his workload can\'t be ignored. With no competition, he should tally upwards of 20-25 touches per week moving forward, including this week at Lambeau. The Packers run defense has steadily improved after getting thrashed by Frank Gore in Week 1. Over its past five games, Green Bay has allowed just 3.7 yards per carry to RBs. Still, the Jag\'s healthy volume is fantasy catnip. Regardless of the matchup, he deserves strong RB2 consideration in 12-team and deeper formats, particularly PPR leagues.'

S"Speaking as an ardent consumer of the Silver Bullet, it's rare BUSH! is imbibed in this space, but this week it's worth shot-gunning in massive quantities. When it comes to defending the run, the Panthers are lightweights. A near lifeless slug could slime a 100-yard, 1-TD trail against them. In six games this season, six running backs have eclipsed the 10-point fantasy mark versus Carolina, including waste of roster space Mark Ingram. Overall, the Panthers have surrendered 184.3 total yards per game and 4.7 yards per carry to RBs this year. Now with Matt Forte operating at full capacity, Bush is only seeing roughly 18-23 snaps per game, but he continues to work as a bloodhound near the goal-line. Given the fantastic matchup, look for his nose to guide him to the end-zone. Chicago, which is starting to click offensively, should benefit from what its defense gifts them. A goal-to-go opportunity or three could be in the offing for Bush. Slot him into your FLEX or RB2 spot in competitive formats this week."

S"Shades of another home run hitting Givens, Ernest, the Rams' version is quickly becoming of the league's premier deep threats. The fleet-footed wideout has recorded a catch of 50 or more yards in four straight games. Essentially, he's everything Danario Alexander was supposed to be. His limited route tree continues to be a hinderance, but he's seen action on 74.5 percent of the Rams' snaps since Week 4. The coaching staff has come up with new, creative ways to get Givens the ball in space, evident in last week's loss to Green Bay. On a simple dump-off, the rookie zig-zagged his way through Packers for a 56-yard gain. More explosive plays are on the docket in Week 8. No defense has allowed more pass plays of 20-plus yards than the Patriots. Corner Kyle Arrington has been especially generous. On the season, his assignments have averaged 15.6 yards per catch and hauled in 80.6 percent of passess targeted. In what should be a voluminous afternoon for Sam Bradford, Givens will deliver terrific WR3 numbers in challenging formats."

S"Over the past few weeks, the Jets have been a popular punchline in fantasy circles. Most would agree watching Hulk Hogan fornicate on film offers more excitement than employing the services of any Jet. But Kerley is trying to change that perception. Though the end-zone has remained elusive, the shifty wideout has totaled 8.7 targets, 5.0 receptions and 79.3 yards per game over the past three weeks. His 120 yards last week against New England established a new career high, prompting Mark Sanchez to wax poetically about him post-game. Expect Kerley to carry over momentum into a huge clash with Miami. The Dolphins are one of the league's most rigid defenses against the run, but near opposite verus the pass. Sean Smith and Richard Marshall have executed well at times, but Kerley's open-field slipperiness and route savvy will likely prove problematic. PPR owner, continue to disrespect 'The Kernel' and you deserve to scrub toliets with a toothbrush."

S"Admittedly, Hillis was a staple on the Noise's preseason sleeper list. Just two years removed from his remarkable breakout campaign in Cleveland and reteamed with former Browns offensive coordinator Brian Daboll in KC, his immediate future seemed blindingly bright. However a high ankle sprain dashed hopes for a rebound. At least, temporarily. With several weeks left on the docket, there's still time for Hillis to regain respectability. Back at practice this week, Romeo Crennel is optimistic he'll be in uniform against division rival Oakland Sunday. It's unknown exactly how many touches he'll net. Shaun Draughn and Cyrus Gray filled the void blandly in his absence, averaging a combined 14.0 touches per game and 2.6 yards per carry. But with the staff seemingly committed to reduce Jamaal Charles' workload, the complement should carve out a substantial role immediately. Oakland has tightened the defensive screws over the past couple weeks, but remains an exploitable unit, especially away. The Raiders have given up 4.9 yards per carry in road games. Don't be surprised if the Chiefs, well-rested and determined to jumpstart their offense, lean heavily on JC and The Battering Ram with Brady Quinn under center. If you're in dire straits for a FLEX option, head for the Hillis."

S'In Cam\'s suggestion box one can only hope some scorned fantasy owner submitted a piece of paper with "Pull head out of posterior" scribbled on it. The first half of the regular season has been a calamitous downfall for the prized early-round pick. Mired in a deep sophomore slump, he\'s regressed in every category imaginable, a dramatic decline that has many questioning his overall attitude, leadership skills and decision-making in high leverage situations. Though his per game average is still straddling the QB top-10, he\'s largely unreliable. Warren Moon\'s recent comments suggesting people are "overreacting" to Cam\'s sliding play obviously isn\'t representative of the fantasy community. His value, when compared to his draft day price, is drowning in the red. This week likely won\'t increase owner confidence. Chicago, on pace to best takeaway totals tallied by the legendary \'85 team, is on the brink of becoming of the league\'s greatest defenses ever. Da Bears have yet to allow a multi-TD passer this season or a 16-point signal caller in Yahoo! standard leagues. They\'ve also limited passers to a mere 6.1 yards per attempt. Newton\'s strong ground presence always makes him a threat to score, no matter the opponent, but until he reconnects with Steve Smith downfield another Sunday filled with unanswerable questions is on tap.'

S"After a searing start, the Riddler, who's lost snaps to Brandon Bolden, Danny Woodhead and, most recently, Shane Vereen, has bewildered owners of late. Bill Beelzechick's fast spinning merry-go-round at RB has made it impossible to predict just who will rise to the occasion in a given week. On paper, Ridley may sit atop the depth-chart, but in practice he's not necessarily the primary option, even in goal-line packages. Only The Hoodie knows. Don't expect the always guarded coach to show his hand anytime soon. Despite the ever-changing backfield, Ridley remains on pace for 1,346 rushing yards, which would be the fourth-best mark in franchise history. Still, he's only played on 40.1 percent of the team's snaps the past two weeks, which has led to consecutive dud performances. Sadly, the string of disappointments could stretch another week. No longer 'rancid,' the 'respectable' Rams haven't been mowed down on the ground compared to years past. Over the past five weeks they've held opposing rushers to just 3.3 yards per carry. Most impressively, brand names Alfred Morris, Reggie Bush and then starter Michael Bush, failed to top 90 yards on the ground against them. Under Jeff Fisher's direction, linebackers JoLonn Dunbar and James Laurinaitis have done a marvelous job, combining for 51 stops. Better days are ahead for the Riddler, but St. Louis isn't the pushover it once was."

S"At first glance, Bush's matchup with the Jets is a savory one. Over the majority of the season, the Puddle Jumpers have had their difficulties plugging the gap. C.J. Spiller and Arian Foster, who each eclipsed 150 rushing yards, trampled them. And in their first meeting back in Week 3 on South Beach, Bush, Daniel Thomas and Lamar Miller smoked New York on the ground rolling up 178 yards on 38 carries. Don't expect a repeat performance the second time around. On defense, the Jets have rediscovered their stalwart personality over the past couple weeks. Versus Indy and New England, they surrendered a mere 3.7 yards per carry to RBs. Bush entered the bye on  a sour note. Since his 172-yard, 2-TD dismantling of Oakland in Week 2, he failed to exceed 75 total yards and scored only one time in the four games that followed, mediocre numbers Bush attributed to stacked boxes. Because of New York's rather stingy secondary, a heavy dose of eight-man fronts is likely on the horizon for the running back. Shallow leaguers, don't bank on him."

S'Nicks\' 2012, a season that promised to be one of virtual football\'s best, hasn\'t quite lived up to the enormous expectations. Knee swelling and complications with his surgically repaired foot have greatly hindered his overall performance. But the former All-Pro boasted late last week he\'s "feeling better." Though he again underwhelmed last Sunday, he did return to a full practice Wednesday, a strong indication he\'s nearing full strength. Unfortunately, he may be another week away from contributing at an elite level. The Cowboys present a tall task. Corner Brandon Carr has sloughed in recent games, but rookie Morris Claiborne, who\'s allowed a mere 11.8 yards per catch, and safeties Danny McCray and Gerald Sensabaugh continue to play above average versus the pass. In the rivals\' first meeting, Dallas\' secondary did a marvelous job containing Victor Cruz and a weakened Nicks. The tandem combined for only 10 receptions and 96 yards. On the season, only a pair of Brandons, Marshall and Funston LaFell, have reached the 10-point threshold against Big D. Eli Manning has booted the \'Boys repeatedly in the past, but don\'t anticipate Nicks to match what he accomplished in Dallas last year (8-163-0).'

S"V-Jax is the Law of Gravity personified, a classic example of 'what goes up, must come down.' Coming off a history-making effort last week against New Orleans in which he totaled a franchise-record 216 yards, he is seemingly destined for a letdown. In seven games off a 100-plus yard performance since 2010, he scored just two touchdowns and averaged a lowly 2.8 receptions and 41.8 yards per game. No doubt, Jackson has been a Dreamsicle this year. His 14.8 per game average in standard formats is the third-best among wideouts. His terrific blend of size and athleticism have left many defensive coordinators dumbfounded. However, his open-field speed is similar to a peg-legged pirate's, indicative in Malcolm Jenkins' heroic run-down of Jackson Week 7 versus the Saints. This week, it's doubtful Jackson will see as much open space. The Vikings' Cover 2 scheme is designed to take away the big play. And his probable assignment, Antoine Winfield, has played brilliantly this season. The corner, who ranks No. 5 in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus, has allowed just 10.7 yards per catch. In what will likely be another pitiful display of Thursday Night Football, presumably for both teams, the Buccaneer walks off the plank."

S"Fantasy's favorite ginger may be a soulless being hell-bent on blinding the world population with his Flaming Hot Cheetohs hair and ghostly pale skin, but, overlooked by most, he's quite an effective fantasy quarterback. Through two weeks Raggedy Andy has averaged 20.2 fantasy points per game, the 14th-best mark among signal callers. He's also completed nearly 68 percent of his attempts tallying a healthy 7.9 YPA. The emergence of slot threat Andrew Hawkins has greatly bolstered a passing attack that was loaded with question marks outside A.J. Green and Jermaine Gresham. With viable weapons at his disposal and given the gross inadequacies of the Bengals' secondary, Dalton has been pressed into a couple high-volume situations, fueling his overall worth. Expect that trend to continue in the nation's capital. Considering Robert Griffin III's elite standing and Cincy's defensive issues, another 35-plus attempts are on the docket for Dalton. The 'Skins, smarting after season-ending injuries to Brian Orakpo and Adam Carriker, are very vulnerable. No defense has surrendered more passing TDs through two weeks (six). Without a formidable pass rush, the Bengals should thrive downfield. Roll with Big Red."

S"According to an ESPN Chicago report, Matt Forte, who Lovie Smith claims didn't suffer a high ankle sprain in Green Bay, hasn't been ruled out for Week 3. However, unless he possesses the magical healing powers of Tim Tebow, it seems highly unlikely the incumbent will suit up versus St. Louis. Assuming Forte is deactivated, owners need to crack open an ice cold BUSH!!! The backup may never be the flashiest rusher on the field, but he's a tough, old-school bruiser who typically racks appreciable yards through attrition. Filling the void for Darren McFadden last season in nine games last season in Oakland, he averaged a fabulous 116.3 total yards per game and totaled five touchdowns. Yes, the Bears offensive line couldn't repel a hard-charging stuffed animal right now, but its run-blocking has been semi-adequate. Because of his bulldozing nature, Bush can generate laudable yards in unfavorable situations. He ranked 14th in the league in total yards after contact last year. Look for him to tattoo St. Louis. The Rams have yielded 4.9 yards per carry to opposing RBs thus far. Kevin Smith and Alfred Morris looked terrific against them. Due to Jay Cutler's ongoing problems, look for Mike Tice to load up Bush's plate some 20-plus times, making the Bear a top-15 play in Week 3."

S'The biggest eyesore for 0-2 KC might be its run game, an area most fanalysts, including yours truly, thought would be the team\'s primary strength. Jamaal Charles, though commendable versus Atlanta Week 1, was befuddled in Buffalo, totaling a miserable 21 yards on nine touches. Hillis, equally deplorable, also hasn\'t measured up. Through two weeks he\'s averaged just 5.8 fantasy points per game, the 42nd-best output among rushers, one spot ahead of "living legend" Curtis Brinkley. His humiliating fumble lost at the goal-line in Buffalo pretty much sums up his woeful production thus far. However, all hope isn\'t lost. Yes, New Orleans has sound odds of hanging a 40 spot on the Chiefs at home this week, but KC, desperate to establish its ground game and control the clock, will lean heavily on its un-dynamic duo. Because the Saints are arguably the league\'s worst defense, multiple goal-to-go situations are in the offing, possibly setting Hillis up for more than one end-zone kneel. New Orleans has given up five ground scores and the third-most fantasy points to RBs already this year. Given Charles\' worrisome knee soreness and the friendly matchup, the former fantasy star is flexy sexy in 12-team and deeper leagues.'

S"So far this season, Crabtree has resembled a Dyson vacuum. The receiver is sucking up everything in sight, a testament to his tacky hands and Alex Smith's accuracy. He's hauled in 13 of 16 targeted passes, good for an outstanding 81.3 catch percentage. A valuable asset in PPR leagues, he could develop into a one-man wrecking crew this week in standard formats. Minnesota's secondary is quite sheepish. Paltry pair, Antoine Winfield and Chris Cook, have allowed a combined catch rate of 62.5 percent. Last week, they were repeatedly torched by Reggie Wayne and Donnie Avery. And let's not worry about Randy Moss wresting away looks from Crabs. Sure his return to his old stomping grounds is a fantastic headline for mainstream journalists, but he'll likely make a minimal fantasy impact. The future HOFer has seen only 28.5 percent of the Niners' snaps thus far. Vernon Davis is arguably Smith's true No. 1, but Crabtree isn't far behind. This week, employ him as a WR2 in 10-team and deeper leagues."

S"After serving a one-game suspension, Britt barely made a peep in his return. Against San Diego he was eased back into action, playing 19 snaps while recording just one catch for five yards. However, he emerged from the game unscathed, noting his tender knees experienced no repercussions. Expected to have his workload ramped up this week versus the Lions, he should be reinserted into starting lineups. The Titans offense may be in a  discombobulated state, but Jake Locker's howitzer arm bodes well for Britt's fantasy chances. So does Detroit's ravaged secondary. Though starters Chris Houston, Louis Delmas and Bill Bentley are close to returning, there are no guarantees they will be available in Week 3. Drayton Florence, meanwhile, is out indefinitely after shattering his forearm last week in San Fran. Due to the numerous setbacks, it's no surprise the Lions have conceded 7.6 yards per attempt on the young year. Provided he isn't incarcerated prior to kickoff, Britt is worth sliding in as a WR3 in 12-team and deeper leagues."

Kevin Smith has performed admirably over the first two games, but Leshoure is clearly the better talent. Don\'t let his lackluster 2.2 YPC in exhibition play fool you. He\'s a between the tackles grinder with excellent open-field burst, terrific vision and plush hands. In other words, he\'s the consummate three-down back, and a perfect fit for the Lions\' zone-blocking scheme. This is why Linehan and company believe "He\'s the real deal" and why the Free Press recently proclaimed he\'ll be the starter "before long." Detroit, desperate to establish a consistent power run game, sorely needs his services. Smith may supplant him initially in passing situations, but look for Leshoure to be deployed immediately on early downs. Tennessee, battered in all facets defensively, is a zesty matchup. The Titans surrendered 125 rush yards to Stevan Ridley Week 1 and made Jackie Battle look like Natrone Means last Sunday. Overall, they\'ve allowed 4.2 yards per carry and 185.5 total yards per game to RBs equal to the fourth-most fantasy points. Turn Leshoure loose.'

S'This week, Ray Lewis and friends will stain the "toughest metrosexual\'s" sheepskin UGG boots. Fresh off an earth-shattering home loss to Arizona, the Pats will attempt to regain their composure in one of the NFL\'s most thankless environments, M&T Bank Stadium. Though his final Week 2 output was quite respectable (316-1-1), Brady was largely uneven against Arizona. Cardinals bookends Calais Campbell and Darnell Docket dominated the line of scrimmage, forcing four sacks. Despite being under duress just 19-percent of the time, Brady looked occasionally bewildered. The increased pocket pressure and loss of Aaron Hernandez in the first half knocked New England off-kilter. Another onslaught should be expected in Baltimore. Over their first two games (vs. CIN and PHI), the Ravens blitzed on 40-percent of the time. In total, they\'ve forced six turnovers and tallied six sacks. If the Pats\' pass protection again wanes, it could be another long, frustrating four quarters for the sloth-footed signal caller. It\'s imperative historical safety blanket Wes Welker, whose sudden decline has been the subject of much discussion, elevates his game. Recall in the conference championship a season ago versus Baltimore Brady salvaged an otherwise lousy day (239-0-2) with a 1-yard TD sneak. In the rematch, the model-faced QB may resemble Medusa.'

S"Many will claim the Noise has officially lost his marbles advertising one of the league's elite rushers in this space, but any player, regardless of clout, isn't completely immune to fantasy failure. Last season, Arian Foster, who bested McCoy in per game average by almost a full point, registered three Lame-worthy performances on the year. The Eagles Pro Bowler, one of the steadiest producers in the virtual game, totaled only four underwhelming efforts. He is arguably the most well-rounded back in the league today. But don't be shocked if Week 3 is his first face-plant of 2012. The Cardinals, as discussed above, are a defense on the rise. Their mind-blowing containment of New England last week was completely unexpected. Still, even given its ups and downs, Arizona has executed well at home in recent years, especially versus the run. In their past nine games at the UPS, the Desert Birds have conceded just 3.7 yards per carry to visiting rushers, including limiting Marshawn Lynch to 97 yards on 23 touches (4.2 ypt) Week 1. McCoy blasted AZ for 93 total yards and a touchdown last season in Philly. However, in the rematch, a pair of aces may not be in the Cards. Replacement refs with fantasy interests be warned."

S"What Peterson has accomplished roughly nine months removed to annihilating his ACL/MCL is nothing short of extraordinary. His regenerative healing factor is akin to Wolverine's. Through two games, he's splashed six twice and totaled 167 yards, averaging a characteristic 4.4 yards per carry. Impressively 71 of his 144 rushing yards have come after contact. However, despite his miraculous recovery and early season performance, the Purple Jesus likely won't carry his followers to the Promised Land in Week 3. San Francisco's impervious frontline presents a major roadblock. Hole plungers Patrick Willis and NaVorro Bowman currently rank inside the top-7 in run coverage according to Pro Football Focus. The pair have already combined for 10 stops (Plays that result in offensive failure). Equally daunting, since Week 1 of 2010, a span of 34 regular season games, opposing rushers have averaged just 3.4 yards per carry versus the Gold Panners. And only four have eclipsed the century mark in a game during that span. Peterson may be at or near 100-percent, but this week, he'll likely churn out only half his normal output."

S"Though Mike Williams flashed playmaker skills in his rookie season, most agree, big-play ability the upside of Jackson's hasn't been seen in Tampa since the days of Joey Galloway. And that was an eternity ago. But for fantasy's rollercoaster ride, it's one week up, one week down. Coming off a monstrous game in New York (10-5-128-1), it would only seem appropriate for Jackson to pull a Houdini in Big D. Dallas defensive backs Brandon Carr and rookie Morris Claiborne have played marvelously thus far. Versus the rival Giants Week 1 and the Seahawks last Sunday, no wideout surpassed 60 yards against them. Most outstandingly, Carr has surrendered a mere 37.5-percent catch rate. In other words, the man has blanketed his assignments. Jackson's height and supreme athleticism are tough to contain, but last year in games where he topped the 100-yard mark the week before, he averaged just 36 yards in the followup. Again, the man is the essence of inconsistency. Take the odds. He disappears in Dallas."

S"When Thomas was separated at birth from twin Brandon Marshall, he apparently took both of their hands with him. The wideout, whose muscular frame and excellent athleticism are eerily similar to the ex-Bronco's, has become the apple of Peyton Manning's eye, particularly inside the red-zone. In the early going, he's out-targeted teammate Eric Decker 18-to-15, hauling in 13 receptions for 188 yards and two touchdowns. His resulting 15.4 fantasy points per mark sits atop the pole position among wide receivers. His breakout season, which many projected once elder Manning came aboard, is well underway. However, even the studliest pass catchers take the occasional siesta, an unfortunate outcome that could impact Thomas this week. Houston, one of the league's finest defenses top-to-bottom, has grounded the pass. Of the 21 balls thrown Kareem Jackson and Jonathan Joseph's direction only 42.8 percent reached their destinations unobstructed. No surprise, both DBs rank inside Pro Football Focus' pass coverage top-20. And don't automatically assume their soft early schedule has greatly inflated the pair's prowess. Joseph was especially spectacular last year. Thomas is a strong, physical receiver who wins most one-on-one battles, but Joseph, though giving up three inches, is equally tenacious. If Manning's downfield throws flutter again, it could be a quiet day in Denver for DT."

S"From the neck up, Luck has the appearance of a rocket scientist. His geeky smile and occasional Amish-beard are not exactly representative of an insanely talented athlete. But similar to fellow football dweebs Peyton Manning and Eli Manning, the Stanford product is an incredibly smart passer who's transitioned somewhat smoothly to the pro game. Over his first three games, the No. 1 pick averaged 23.4 points per game, good for 11th-best among signal callers. His lowly 53.4 completion percentage is nothing to write home about \xe2\x80\x94 Coby Fleener drops have done him zero favors \xe2\x80\x94 but his 40.6 attempts per game and contributions on the ground (26.7 rush yards per game) have masked otherwise discouraging inefficiencies. Still, expect 'Pump up the Volume' to be the rookie's theme song again this week versus Green Bay. Thus far, the Pack has defended the pass unevenly. Against meek competition (e.g. Russell Wilson and Jay Cutler) it thrived. However, versus Alex Smith and Drew Brees it dived. In those two contests, Sam Shields and friends surrendered 8.2 yards per attempt. Indy's protection issues are a concern, but due to the Colts' accommodating defense, another 40-plus throws are in the offing for Luck. With Tony Romo, Matthew Stafford and Carson Palmer on bye, he's a borderline top-10 option in Week 5."

S"With Beanie 'The Weenie' officially cooked until November, the door of opportunity was wide open for Williams last week versus Miami. Unfortunately, he tripped on the threshold. The popular waiver add finished with a meager 27 total yards on just 14 touches. The Cardinals, playing from behind most of the game, employed no-huddle, forcing Williams, who has struggled mightily in pass protection, to the sidelines. In total, he saw action on only 33 of 74 snaps. Despite underwhelming in the blocking department, other questions loom about the second-year back. Running behind 'Zona's sketchy offensive line, he's seen few holes and when lanes have opened up, he's exuded a lack of explosiveness. Still, he's the most talented rusher currently on the Cardinals' active roster. And, based on the friendly matchup, this could be the week he finally delivers. Under Jeff Fisher's direction, the rancid Rams have greatly improved in pass defense, but remain a sieve up front. They've conceded 4.5 yards per carry, 102 total yards and 1.0 scores per game to RB1s. Though his yards total will likely be modest, Williams should be considered a low end RB2 in 12-team plus leagues this week."

S"In his return to the starting lineup last week in Philly, Bardshaw's totals were largely pedestrian. He averaged a woeful 3.0 yards per carry, saved only by his contributions in the pass game. Overall, he totaled 77 yards on 16 touches. The silver-lining in an otherwise uneventful performance, he out-snapped Andre Brown 55-to-9, reestablishing his standing as Tom Coughlin's primary ball carrier. Still, Kevin Gilbride's insistence on riding the 'hot hand' doesn't mean Bradshaw is a weekly lock for 15-20 touches. David Wilson, who was spectacular in the return game Sunday, may reenter the conversation soon. The rook's electric speed and break-tackle ability are exactly what the Giants ground game needs. Provided he shackles the pill, he could see more reps out of the backfield in short order. However, Bradshaw should remain the bell-cow this week versus Cleveland. The Browns, anchored by nose tackle Athyba Rubin, have sniffed out the run fairly well this year. They've yet to allow a rushing touchdown and held Ray Rice to just 2.7 yards per carry last Thursday. But the Dawg Pound's ongoing back-end problems, primarily due to Joe Haden's absence, should pave the way for the G-Man to earn a few goal-line carries. Despite the Giants' fluid backfield and suspect offensive line play, Bradshaw is start worthy this week."

S"Lost in the Brian Hartline hysteria, the Tenderoni continues to do what he does best: run precise routes, exploit soft spots in zone or man coverage and suck up everything within arm's reach, all the while racking superb PPR numbers in challenging formats. Against the Jets and Cardinals he recorded 12 receptions for 209 yards. And among receivers with at least 30 targets, he ranks seventh in catch percentage (66.7). Yes, end-zone splashes are few and far between for the veteran, but, like Hartline and Ryan Tannehill, he's excelling within Joe Philbin's Green Bay-styled offense. At first glance, this week's matchup in Cincinnati isn't for the faint of heart. Only one receiver, Mohamed Massaquoi in Week 3, surpassed 65 yards in a game against the Bengals this season. However, corners Nate Clements, Terrance Newman and Pacman Jones combined have yielded a 58.1 catch percentage to their assignments. Given Bess' ability to get open, Tannehill's growing confidence and the added attention Hartline will likely draw, the former Hawaii standout is an above average WR3 play this week in PPR settings."

S"With only six receptions for 92 yards (on 15 targets) and zero touchdowns it seems Meachem is enrolled in a witness protection program. Expected to fill the void left by departed target Vincent Jackson, he's fallen completely off the fantasy grid. But in a homecoming game that will likely offer plenty of offensive fireworks, the ex-Saint should emerge from his early season hiding. Though he's contributed little in the box score, Meachem has seen 71.5-percent of the team's snaps, second only to Malcom Floyd. Uncharacteristically, however, he's grabbed just one pass beyond 10 yards, deployed often as a shallow cross receiver. But look for him to get back to his 'streaky' ways in what promises to be a shootout Sunday night in the Superdome. New Orleans has allowed the fourth-most fantasy points to WRs and 15 pass plays of 20-plus yards, the 11th-most in the league. If there was ever a week for Meachem to register a pulse, this is it."

S'The buttery-handed wide receiver is in desperate need of a hand transplant. Owners who have loyally stuck by his side can only hope Jerry Rice is a willing donor. Little has always possessed the physical tools needed to be a reliable pass catcher. However, his concentration lapses and questionable route-running has stunted his growth. Stretching back to last year, he\'s dropped 19 passes, the most in the league. His late miscue in last week\'s near upset at Baltimore was a definite black eye. But, despite his problems, Pat Shurmur admitted his WR1 has "made progress" in "areas that may not always be obvious to people." On the brink of a breakout, he has sound odds of finally putting it all together this week at The Met. The Giants secondary, ravaged by injuries and ineptitude, presents an excellent matchup. Overall, New York ranks sixth in most fantasy points allowed to WRs. Five receivers have eclipsed the 10-point mark against it this season. Worst yet, its top cover-man, Corey Webster, ranks dead last in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus. Obviously, the Browns offensive line must adequately protect Brandon Weeden against NY\'s aggressive pass rush. If it can carry out that task, Little will bark loudly.'

S"Vick may be spending cash like a Lotto millionaire (Damn creditors!), but unless his play quickly improves, he may soon be pinching pennies alongside destitute two-time Pro Bowler Vince Young. In what was supposed to be a bounce back season, the controversial QB has scored modestly. His 23.4 points per game checks in at No. 12 among passers. Badgered repeatedly in the pocket, it's amazing he's not buried six feet under. Considering Philly's offensive line inadequacies, look for Dick LeBeau to throwing everything and the kitchen sink at the vulnerable signal caller. So far this season, Vick has been placed under duress on 45.8-percent of his drop-backs, the highest amount in the league. No surprise, he's completed just 37.5-percent of his attempts in high-heat situations. In an attempt to alleviate pressure, Andy Reid will make it a top priority to feed LeSean McCoy early. But Pittsburgh, which returns Troy Polamalu and James Harrison to the lineup off the bye, has allowed only 3.5 YPC and just one 100-yard rusher in its past 17 home games. If the Eagles fail to strike a balance, Vick will undoubtedly struggle. Keep in mind the Steelers have allowed a lowly 6.8 yards per attempt this season. Traditional backups Andy Dalton, Andrew Luck and Christian Ponder are stronger starts."

S"If you thought Dallas' offensive performance against Chicago was a train-wreck, count on Jacksonville's imitating a bomb-strapped gasoline tanker crashing head-on into a nuclear reactor. Despite upgrades in the wide receiver corps, the Jags are again one of the league's most laughable passing offenses. For that reason, the workhorse has found little breathing room this season. Still, he remains on pace to match totals in rushing yards, receptions and receiving yards from 2009 (1,391-53-374). Unless Blaine Gabbert suddenly morphs into Mark Brunell circa 1997, a second-straight lousy week is in the offing for the reigning rush king. MJD's lame status hinges on Urlacher's and the entire Chicago linebacker corps' execution. Though the defender has clearly lost a step in pass coverage, he remains an enforcer plugging the gap. So far this season, the Monsters of the Midway have surrendered a mere 3.4 yards per carry and the third-fewest fantasy points to RBs. Jacksonville's offensive line is light years better than Dallas', but if the Bears control the line of scrimmage like it did Monday night, it could be a frustrating afternoon for the Oompah Loompah. Mike Mularkey, who admitted he underfed his rusher Week 4 versus Cincinnati, will definitely call No. 32 often, but, based on the unfavorable matchup, bank on an unsavory final line."

S"CJ2LAME is fantasy's most feared axe-murderer. Just when you think a sense of security has overtaken, he jumps out of the shadows and lops your head off. Coming off his first 100-yard performance since last December, owners who stood loyally by his side probably feel he's a safe play. But they are only kidding themselves. As the rusher remarked earlier this week he'll only be as good as his offensive line, a convenient excuse considering his timidity and persistent swing-for-the-fences running style are equally to blame. Of his 58 attempts this year 37.9-percent have gone for 1-yard or less. Spearheaded by Chad Greenway, the new Purple People Eaters have yet to surrender a rushing touchdown and have allowed a meager 3.1 yards per carry to RBs. Overall, they've given up the second-fewest fantasy points to RBs. Because the Titans O-line couldn't seal off a scarecrow, the pocket will be bombarded with run and pass blitzes this week, a bad sign with stone statue Matt Hasselbeck under center. Unless Tennessee miraculously wins the battle up front, more negative plays are in the forecast for this season's biggest disappointment. Only the iron-stomached should trust his services."

S"About the only headline Smith has written through the first four weeks were comments regarding Cam Newton's not so stellar leadership qualities. So far the multi-time Pro Bowler has posted a deflating 9.0 fantasy points per game in standard formats, the 31st-best output among wide receivers. On pace for 100 targets, 29 fewer than last season, he's lost looks to emerging weapons Brandon LaFell and Greg Olsen. At 33, some would say he's slowing down, but his 20.5 yards per catch suggests otherwise. Still, this week's matchup doesn't bode well for the veteran. Corners Brandon Browner and Richard Sherman are one of the league's best tandems. This year, the pair have allowed a bland 12.6 yards per catch to their assignments. Because they surrender few explosive pass plays, this is a game that favors Olsen underneath. Expect a decent yardage clip from Smith, but don't expect him to get off the TD snide."

S"The gregarious wide receiver won't admit to it, but he and Ryan Fitzpatrick are indeed 'out of synch.' Clearly, chemistry issues are plaguing the pair. In two of Buffalo's past three games, the quarterback has looked Stevie's direction only twice, crazy when you consider the passer totaled 58 attempts in those games. Expect the disconnect to continue. San Francisco, once again, has asserted itself as the league's most balanced defense. Though Carlos Rogers and Tarell Brown have conceded a 76.1 catch percentage, only James Jones Week 1 reached the double-digit threshold in fantasy points against them. And, in total, the Niners have yielded the fourth-fewest fantasy points to WRs. With the added attention Johnson is sure to receive over-the-top, C.J. Spiller and Fred Jackson are the Bills to fear. Stretching back to last year, San Fran has struggled at times defending the flat."

S'Weak, noodle-like, \'tired\' \xe2\x80\xa6 Manning\'s arm may not be "Eli-astic" but it was undoubtedly the most overblown story spewed by a bored New York media during an otherwise uneventful Giants bye week. Yes, Tom Coughlin\'s passing offense has dragged along at a sluggish pace since Eli\'s 337 yard, 1-TD effort versus Washington in Week 7, but the one-week siesta is exactly what the doctor ordered. Pro Football Talk reported Monday the passer\'s regained "pop" on this throws. Truthfully, Manning, sans for the lack of TDs, has actually tallied numbers on par with recent seasons. His completion percentage (61.3), yards per game (264.1) and yards per attempt (7.3) are well above career averages. But because Fantasyland is an instant gratification society, underwhelming numbers over a three-game stretch are unwelcome and unacceptable. Hopefully you bought on the bear. The Giants\' matchup in Week 12 is outstanding. Green Bay\'s defense, sans Charles Woodson, Clay Matthews and other key players, is an exploitable unit. Though it\'s conceded just 6.7 yards per attempt since Week 7, four straight QBs have thrown for at least 255 yards and a TD against it. With Hakeem Nicks finally back to 100-percent and the Giants desperate to resuscitate it\'s aerial attack, look for Eli to storm out of the bye with guns ablazin\'. In a contest where points will be plentiful, anticipate a top-10 finish.'

S'The most effective back in Black isn\'t Darren McFadden, Mike Goodson or Taiwan Jones. Unquestionably, it\'s Reece. Gifted a full complement of touches over the past two weeks, he\'s seized the moment. In consecutive starts, the wonderfully skilled fullback, quite possibly the finest route-runner among rushers in the league, worked brilliantly underneath and displayed surprising adeptness between the tackles. Against Baltimore and New Orleans, he accounted for 297 total yards, netting a ridiculous 6.9 yards per touch. Reece is a modern day version of Charlie Garner, a Swiss Army knife who\'s graduated from his role as check-down receiver. Considering the anemic performance of the ground game with McFadden, it will be interesting to see how Dennis Allen deploys the juggernaut once DMC is activated. This week, though, the head coach likely many not have to make that decision. Reports indicate Allen is only "hopeful" the slow-healing incumbent will be available in Week 12, making Reece must-start material in Cincy. The Bengals have defended the run better of late, but they\'re still allowing 4.4 yards per carry to RBs on the year. Similar to their effort last week against another ultra-versatile weapon, Jamaal Charles, who totaled 118 yards, Geno Atkins and friends will struggle at the point of attack. For the emerging RB1, another triple-digit high is in the forecast.'

S"Since August, yours truly has written hundreds of propagandistic words about the rookie. Rarely has he lived up to the hype. He's found the end-zone and surpassed the 80-yard mark in a game only once this year. When healthy, wily veteran Willis McGahee is clearly the primary option. But with Willis officially cooked with a torn MCL, the spotlight is finally shining on Hillman. The youngster is a fleet-footed, slashing back equipped with plus versatility. His blitz pick-up remains a work in progress, but, in terms of raw talent, he's C.J. Spiller-lite. In fact, when Denver drafted him, John Elway felt he landed the next Darren Sproles. No doubt he will yield touches to Lance Ball, and possibly Blowshon Moreno, on third downs, but he should net a 13-16 touch workload against the Chiefs, a club so unbelievably bad it was partially to blame for a fan's recent death. On the year, KC has surrendered a very friendly 4.6 yards per carry to RBs. Six rushers, including 'living legends' Jackie Battle and LeGarrette Blount, achieved Flame status against it since Week 4. If you're pining for points at the FLEX, hike the Hill in Week 12."

S"There's no disputing the Jets offense is several levels below atrocious. A New York comedian could make a career out of Mark Sanchez/Tim Tebow punchlines. But any inept club is one favorable matchup away from cranking out quality fantasy numbers. For the Puddle Jumpers, Week 12 is one such occasion. When the Jets and Pats first battled in Week 7, NY's vertical game actually didn't suck the hind teet. Sanchez completed 28 of 41 passes for a season-high 328 yards and a TD. In that contest, Kerley was the passer's weapon of choice grabbing a season-best seven balls (on 11 targets) for 120 yards. The acquisition of Aqib Talib is the shot in the arm the Pats secondary needed, but the unit, as a whole, remains very susceptible to big plays. In total, it's allowed 51 pass play of 20-plus yards, far and away the most in the league. Equally encouraging for Kerley owners, a whopping 10 wideouts have scored at least 10 fantasy points against it, including T.Y. Hilton last week. Start the Jet Thanksgiving night and chances are you'll smother your opponent in points, gravy."

S"The Hen House, in quite possibly the most shocking development of Week 11, yielded several golden eggs against the league's top-ranked defense, Houston, on the road. After he replaced wing dinged starter Blaine Gabbert midway through the first quarter, the veteran improbably resembled Mark Brunell circa '95, ripping off numerous explosive pass plays en route to a 354-4-0-11 fantasy day, the third-best output by a signal caller Sunday. Henne only completed 48.5 percent of his attempts, but he got playmakers Cecil Shorts and Justin Blackmon involved and took multiple shots downfield. His 10.7 yards per attempt was the highest of his career. With the plug officially pulled on Gabbert, expect the Henne bombardment to continue. In Tennessee's past six contests, five quarterbacks have tallied at least 21 fantasy points against it, including the mediocre likes of Ryan Fitzpatrick and Jay Cutler. Overall, the Titans have allowed the ninth-most fantasy points to QBs, surrendering 7.7 yards per attempt. Another 300-plus yards may be a stretch, but due to Jacksonville's inadequacies on defense, he's capable of at least a top-15 tally. In deeper leagues, drink up all the Hennessy you got on your shelf."

S"The two-time MVP is again doing what he always does: Wake up next to his lingerie model wife. Slip on his favorite pair of Uggs. Drive to stadium. Shell defenses. Suffice it to say, it's good being Brady. Currently the sixth-best passer in Fantasyland and on pace to score his third-best season in his illustrious career, he's again delivering rock solid QB1 results. But any given week any 'stud' is capable of posting a dud, which could happen to Mr. Bundchen in Week 12. Over the past three seasons, a span of five games, Brady has grounded the Jets, averaging 296.6 yards per game while throwing for 12 touchdowns, including a 259-2-0 effort back in Week 7. However, this year's Jets brand, similar to years past, has defended the pass very well, even without it's blanket corner Darrelle Revis. Since Week 3 only Brady and Russell Wilson have eclipsed the 20-point threshold against New York. Though minus Rob Gronkowski, New England is overloaded with weapons. Aaron Hernandez and Julian Edelman should fill the void admirably. But, at home, with slim wildcard hopes on the line, Antonio Cromartie and company elevate their game. For one-week only, Tom Terrific gives way to Tom Tepid."

S"For those in non-PPR leagues there's an argument to be made Rice hasn't delivered on his top-three promise. Three of his past four games have been especially disappointing. During that stretch he's managed just 3.2 yards per carry. Though he's tallied a few monster games, most notably against Cincinnati, New England and Dallas, his 14.5 per game output is a far cry from the 18.6 mark he notched a season ago. No question Rice remains one of the league's most versatile rushers, but with few holes to plow through his numbers have suffered. Another uneventful line could be on the docket in Week 12. Overlooked by most, San Diego might be the most underrated run defense in the entire league. Only the Texans and Bucs have surrendered fewer yards on the ground. On the season, rushers have plodded their way to a mere 3.9 yards per carry against it. Most impressively, Trent Richardson is the only plowshare to reach the 12-point threshold versus the Chargers since Week 5. And it's not like they faced a group of legless high schoolers over that span. Jamaal Charles, Willis McGahee (twice) and Doug Martin, to a certain extent, were all held in check. Rice is indispensable in PPR settings, but another marginal performance could be in the offing for traditional leaguers."

S"For much of the season, the Noise has gleefully rode shotgun in 'The Butler's' 1991 Mazda sedan. Through 12 weeks, he stands No. 12 among rushers in per game average, silencing skeptics who were convinced Lucifer Shanahan would never stray from a rotational backfield. Though he's posted a middling 72.7 total yards per game over the past three weeks, his healthy workload and growing role within the pass game are very appealing. Unfortunately, mediocrity will likely reign supreme once again on Turkey Day. Against powerful, downhill rushers, Dallas hasn't executed well this year. Michael Turner, Marshawn Lynch and Trent Richardson all finished with excellent numbers against it. But given Morris' recent under-performance and the national, holiday stage, 'Boys linebacker Anthony Spencer, the third-best run defender among LBs according to Pro Football Focus, should dish out a large helping of stuffing. With matchups against Baltimore, Philly and Cleveland upcoming better days are ahead for Morris. However, this week, expectations should be tempered."

S"Recommending a multi-time Pro Bowl receiver still smoking off a team record 273 receiving yards is an exercise equivalent to searching for Twinkies at convenient stores -- futile. For the past several weeks, Johnson has resembled the uncontainable WR1 many expected him to be, especially in PPR leagues. Over his last four he's snared 8.8 passes for 128.0 yards. Touchdowns have been few and far between, but it's clear, the wideout's tweaked practice regimen has done wonders. Still, there are no guarantees in this matchup-based game. Johnson's Turkey Day opponent, Detroit, is no defensive slouch, particularly in downfield coverage. It's conceded 22 pass plays of 20-plus yards, the third-fewest in the NFL. Corner Chris Houston has allowed a lowly 7.8 yards per catch. Meanwhile, opposing signal callers have only tallied a 41.7 rating against safety Ricardo Silva. Overall, WR1s are averaging a mediocre 55.5 yards per game against the Lions. Smoke may be rising off Johnson, but count on Jim Schwartz and company to extinguish the fire."

S"After hyping Nick Foles last week, the Noise deserves to be stuffed, cooked and drenched in cranberry sauce. I was horribly wrong. Though the rookie still possesses considerable upside, he is light years behind fellow freshmen Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III and even Russell Wilson. The Eagles' wretched offensive line and the QB's poor accuracy on intermediate throws are extremely problematic. Michael Vick should again seize the starting reigns as early as this week, but he's yet to pass NFL-mandated post-concussion tests. Even if he does, it's unlikely his home run hitter will cross the chalk. For all it's defensive flaws, the one area where Carolina has executed admirably is in pass coverage. Just six wide receivers have eclipsed 10 fantasy points against it. In complete disarray offensively, Philly appears to have phoned it in. With Foles likely back under center and LeSean McCoy likely to be sidelined, points will most certainly be a premium, especially for D-Jax. Seek alternatives."

S"Just weeks ago internal discussions at Buccaneers headquarters centered on Freeman's accuracy and whether or not he was the franchise's true quarterback of the present and future. Though he's still completed an uneventful 54.7 percent of his attempts and with Tampa's playoff hopes faint, those thoughts have largely been squashed. Since the Bucs' bye Week 4, The Fro has netted 300.3 passing yards per game and a sterling 18:4 TD:INT split. Many of his throws aren't spot on, but his ability to minimize mistakes and exploit one-on-one matchups downfield with playmakers Vincent Jackson and Mike Williams are quite commendable. His 7.6 yards per attempt ranks eighth in the league. Yes, the Saints have shown some improvement, but they are no mystery defensively. They are the definition of 'vertically challenged.' Starting corners Jabari Greer and Patrick Robinson have surrendered 16.1 yards per catch combined. In Week 7, Freeman chucked 42 passes for 420 yards and three touchdowns versus New Orleans. Because of Tampa's deficient secondary, a similar total wouldn't be farfetched in the rematch. Expect him to score a lucrative booty in Week 15."

S"Despite, totaling a season-best 154 yards and a touchdown in Oakland last Thursday, the 'Blowshon' moniker still applies. However, the definition has changed. The statistical winds the rusher has produced over the past couple weeks has, unexpectedly, toppled the competition. He's not the bounce-off tackle type (2.4 yards after contact/attempt), but he's always possessed employable baseline skills \xe2\x80\x94 excellent pass protector, plus hands, decent interior runner \xe2\x80\x94 which is exactly why he, and not green rookie Ronnie Hillman, was promoted when Willis McGahee succumbed to injury four weeks ago. Moreno will rarely 'wow' spectators, but John Fox's commitment to the run makes him a highly reliable RB2. Over the past three weeks, Moreno has gripped the pigskin 28 times per game. Baltimore is expected to get its defensive leader, Ray Lewis, back this week, which is a significant boost for a sagging unit. Still, even when healthy earlier this season, the Madden pitchman rated below average against the run according to Pro Football Focus. His leadership presence will help the Ravens psychologically, but physical execution may not follow suit. Four rushers since Week 9 have scored at least 10 fantasy points against them, including Alfred Morris last week. It may not be pretty to watch, but look for Knowshon to again eclipse the century mark in total yardage."

S"When cirrhosis of the liver finally places me in a handbasket destined for Hell, I'll have one man and one man only to thank for my eternal damnation, the mystifying Mathews. After I drowned him in praise back in May and stood loyally by his side even when he shattered his collarbone the first week of the preseason, the disappointment has pushed me to take up a rather destructive Fireball habit. Heavily invested in him in six of 10 leagues, no amount of grandpa's medicine has washed away the sorrow. His woeful yards per carry (3.8) and TD output (1) are the primary reasons why he ranks No. 29 among rushers in per game average, a far cry from the RB1 expectations many housed just a few months ago. However, the annual letdown could save some face this week against Carolina. Though the Chargers offensive line has struggled mightily in run-blocking and he'll cede touches to petrified Ronnie Brown on most passing downs, he could inflict sizable damage if granted a similar workload as last week (25 touches at Pit). The Panthers have surrendered three 100-yard rushers in their past four games and 4.9 yards per carry to RBs since Week 10. It's been a forgettable year for the Bolt, but he likely has one lightning strike left in him."

S"Entering the season Gordon was one of my favorite deep Rip Van Winkles. The Baylor product, who rarely saw the field due to his dedicated affinity for the wacky tobacky, has flourished, coincidentally enough, with a quarterback with the last name Weeden throwing him the ball. No longer the one-dimensional wideout who broke onto the scene earlier this season, he's developed into a well-rounded target capable of devouring yards downfield and underneath. Blessed with superb physical tools and speedy wheels, he'll only get better. This week could be another strong step forward in his development. Nearly identical to Tampa, Washington is a defense that sells out the pass to defend the run. Corners DeAngelo Hall, Cedric Griffin and Josh Wilson have each allowed a QB rating of at least 91.0 and catch percentage above 60.5. In other words, they would likely get torched by a WAC team. In total 16 receivers have crossed the 10-point threshold against them. Provided Mother Nature cooperates, Weeden-to-Gordon will hurt the 'Skins."

S"Bess is constantly shrugged off by standard leaguers due to a lack of touchdowns, but he's proved indispensable in competitive PPR leagues. 'Tenderoni,' who has some of the tackiest mitts in the league, has grabbed nearly 63-percent of his passes and developed into more of a downfield threat. Entering the year he averaged a mere 10.3 yards per catch over his previous four seasons. This year, he's netted 12.9 yards per catch, hauling in at least five receptions eight times in 14 games, which is somewhat astonishing with Ryan Tannehill under center. Even more remarkable, he's tallied the same number of targets as Julio Jones (105). This week matched against a below average Jaguars secondary, Bess won't regress. Jacksonville has struggled against slot-types this season. Percy Harvin, Randall Cobb and Ryan Broyles totaled noteworthy numbers against them. Yes, the end-zone will likely remain elusive, but for those with catches on the mind, he's a very employable WR3 who should churn out a double-digit output."

S"It's refreshing to see coaches occasionally abandon gamesmanship, standing by boastful declarations made to the media about player usage. Lions offensive coordinator Scott Linehan expressed his desire to get Bell more involved. Lo and behold he delivered on his promise calling the rusher's number a season-high 17 times at snowy Lambeau. Take note Norv Turner. Though Bell's final stat line didn't alter the earth's tilt in standard leagues, his 96 total yards and five receptions left an indelible mark in PPR formats, an outcome that could be replicated this week. Arizona, coming off its worst loss in franchise history (58-0), is exhausted defensively. The Cardinals' laughable play on offense has taxed Darnell Docket and company greatly. No surprise over the past five weeks, they've allowed the most fantasy points to RBs, giving up 5.4 yards per carry, 150 total yards per game and five ground scores. Bell will continue to split touches with Mikel Leshoure, but another 30-plus snaps and 15-plus touches are on the docket. Assuming Detroit can build an insurmountable early lead, which shouldn't be a problem against a team with a lame-duck coach and JV-level offense, he will likely be deployed often, particularly late. Averaging a dynamite 6.9 yards per touch on the season, he could be a real diamond in the rough in Week 15. Jingle all the way."

S"Over the past three weeks, Rodgers has resembled a year-old box of opened Saltine crackers. His stale numbers during that stretch (249.0 combined ypg, 3:2 td:int split, 18.3 fppg) have tarnished the 'stud's' once impeccable image. Though many owners in the fantasy community moronically adhere to unproven 'always start' theories, the popular first-round pick is worthy of a demotion, provided one has a suitable replacement. Based on his recent string of disappointing efforts and unfavorable Week 15 matchup, the decorated passer's ceiling is uncharacteristically low. Yes, a rash of injuries to key players (e.g. Brian Urlacher and Tim Jennings) have made the  Bears more Berenstain than bruising, but with their backs against the wall they should rise to the occasion. Peanut Tillman remains one of the league's finest turnover catalysts and pass defenders. He ranks third in coverage according to Pro Football Focus, surrendering only 8.6 yards per catch. Jennings, who is targeting a return this week, is equally impressive, yielding a 46.8 QB rating, the fifth-lowest in the league among corners with at least 300 snaps. And safeties Major Wright and Chris Conte rank well above-average defending the pass. Overall, the unyielding secondary has allowed a 12:21 TD:INT split in 13 games. Stifling. In nine career starts, Rodgers has caged his arch-rival tallying a 101.0 QB rating, 243.3 yards per game and 17 touchdowns (1 rush). But possibly minus deep-threat Jordy Nelson and given the harsh road environment, he could post a line nearly identical to what he did in the clubs' first meeting this season (219-1-1), a very supbar performance. This time of year, average means elimination."

S"As expected, Murray's second year, a campaign many sunk a briefcase full of cash into back in August, hasn't lived up to expectations. Riddled by a foot sprain, he again missed a significant portion of the season, frustrating investors greatly. But at or near 100-percent over the past two weeks, the 'Boy has delivered on his early-round promise compiling 88.5 total yards per game and two touchdowns. However, his deceiving final stat line has veiled otherwise lukewarm production. Sure, the fantasy points have been there, but during that stretch he's averaged a pedestrian 3.0 yards per carry. Running behind an under-performing offensive line holes have been, and will continue to be, few and far between. Amazingly, 38 of Murray's 119 rush attempts have gone for one, zero or negative yards. He's the epitome of 'all or nothing.' Pittsburgh's aging defense isn't as scary as years past, but buffet closer Casey Hampton and company are far from vulnerable against the run. On the season they've allowed just 3.7 yards per carry and three 90-yard rushers. In a critical game for both teams, don't expect DeMarvelous numbers."

S"Often times looks can be deceiving. The Buffalo Bills defense is a prime example. Earlier this year, a one-toed sloth could've crawled his way to 100 yards and a touchdown against Blowffalo. Over its first nine games, 10 running backs scored at least 11 fantasy points against it. But since then, Chan Gailey's base 4-3 has stiffened considerably. Nick Barnett, Marcel Dareus,and Kyle Williams, who ranks second only to Geno Atkins defending the run among down linemen according to Pro Football Focus, have spearheaded the sudden about face. Over the their past four games, the trio has surrendered a mere 3.1 yards per carry and the sixth-fewest fantasy points to running backs. Simply put, don't be swayed by the Bills' No. 28 overall ranking versus the run. Lynch, coming off a monstrous 30-point performances against Arizona, is usually an uncontainable beast. Nearly 60-percent of his 1,271 rushing yards have come after contact. But against opponents stiff up the middle he's often disappointed, evident in his languid efforts against New England and Miami. His balky back is also a concern. If the Bills' gap-attacking ways continue, Lynch could be in line for an unsatisfying day."

S"Occasionally derailed by lingering lower-body injuries and erratic play, Nicks hasn't delivered on his WR1 promise. Victor Cruz has again salsaed his way to a top-10 output, but the more toolsy sidekick has paced much slower, checking in at No. 33 in standard league per game average, just behind Andre Roberts and Sidney Rice. Only once this year has the former Pro Bowler reached the 80-yard mark in a game, which happened Week 2 versus Tampa. Though he's crossed the chalk in two of his past three contests, Nicks is a very suspect play in Week 15. Despite Asante Samuel's cranky shoulder, Atlanta has bottled up most high-profiled receivers in recent weeks. Lance Moore and Steve Smith are the only wideouts to reach double-digits in fantasy points against the Falcons since Week 10. Overall, Samuel and fellow DB Robert McClain have given up a combined 68.4 QB rating, ranking them inside the top-20 in pass coverage among eligible corners. Operating at far less than 100-percent and given the difficult matchup, Nicks is a high-risk, medium-reward receiver in Week 15."

S"Snacked on again by the menacing injury imp and plagued by Philadelphia's generally inept offensive line/passing game, Maclin is another notable name who's tortured the souls of his supporters. His 7.9 per game average in standard formats, which checks in at No. 42 at his position, labels him a high-end bench option instead of the upper-tiered WR2 most pegged him as on draft day. However, last week 'Return of the Mack' was Philly's theme song. The wideout burned the Buccaneers, an easily achievable feat, for six receptions, 104 yards and a touchdown, his finest fantasy performance since Week 6. Limited in practice by a strained groin, he is fully expected to play Thursday, but the outlook isn't rosy. Cincy corners Leon Hall and Terrance Newman have executed beautifully against the pass this season, conceding a combined 11.7 yards per catch to their assignments. Overall, the Bengals have allowed the fifth-fewest fantasy points to WRs, holding WR1s to a quiet 42.7 yards per game. Mac goes wack."

S"On Thanksgiving Day in Detroit, Schaub persevered through raucous noise and, thanks to Ndamukong Suh, a pair of cracked huevos en route to his second consecutive 300-plus passing yard performance. Despite being on pace for 4,152 passing yards and 27 touchdowns, the underrated QB continues to receive the stiff arm from owners. In the eyes of many, Houston is a ground oriented club that only occasionally throws. But with Andre Johnson once again impersonating a mythical beast and because of the Texans' struggles in pass coverage, the signal caller has gotten quite the arm workout in recent weeks. Over his past two games, he's attempted 103 passes, averaging an eye-opening 8.1 yards per attempt. The Titans possess little offensive firepower compared to Detroit, but unless Houston suddenly rectifies its defensive woes, another high-volume game could be on the docket. That happens, and Schaub will again finish well-inside the QB top-12. Six of the last seven passers Tennessee faced finished with at least 21 fantasy points, including Chad Henne a week ago. Corner Alterraun Verner has defended the pass exceptionally well this year, yielding a mere 69.5 QB rating. But if Houston can get Johnson in one-on-one situations against Jason McCourty, who has allowed 14.6 yards per catch this season, Schaub will pay an enormous dividend."

S"In a who-can-get-hurt-most-often contest, Matt Forte would probably finish third behind Darren McFadden and Beanie Wells. Down and presumably out again with a wrenched ankle, the brittle back appears to be a long shot to suit up this week against Seattle. For owners who sunk a high-round pick in the 'franchise' rusher, his timing couldn't be more inopportune. The haves, however, vehemently disagree. Bush backers must be ecstatic. The backup should net a substantial workload against an underachieving Seattle front. No longer the ironclad unit it was earlier this season, the 'Hawks D-line has been gashed often up the middle.  Over the past five weeks, it's allowed a mind-blowing 6.3 yards per carry to RBs. Even Miami, a club that couldn't penetrate a light fog in Buffalo two weeks ago, managed to rack 189 rushing yards against Seattle in Week 12. Yes, the Bears' ravaged offensive line is a problem and Bush is a bit of a laggard, but with an expected 20-plus touches on tap, he should finish with a useful yardage total. Highly efficient near the goal-line, a touchdown or two is also possible. Bank on Bush as a RB2 in 12-team and deeper leagues this week."

S"The Model T, Michael Turner, needs to be scrapped. Evidence of his imminent demise continues to mount. For the second straight week, the more dynamic  Rodgers saw more action. During that stretch, the upstart out-snapped the incumbent 65-to-56. In what promises to be a shootout, more of the same could be in order. Those who believe 'Quizz is incapable of shouldering a three-down workload must be legally blind. Equipped with a thick, muscular trunks, explosive feet and soft hands, he's a diminutive dynamo built to handle 15-20 touches with regularity. Turner will continue to hammer it home when needed, but another 12-plus touches could be on the horizon for Rodgers. Scorching over the past three weeks, he's averaged a ridiculous 6.9 yards per touch, including a 62-total yard performance (on seven touches) on the bayou in Week 10. Attempting 39.0 passes per game, Atlanta is unequivocally a throw-first, throw-often team. Against a New Orleans secondary that's allowed a league-worst 8.5 yards per attempt, that won't change. Still, Rodgers is the best back the Falcons have. And if his 12-touch load last week is any indication of what Mike Smith is thinking, he may have finally displaced Turner on the depth-chart, a change that was warranted months ago. Against fantasy's most generous run defense, expect sizable results from Atlanta's little big man."

S"Even on a busted wheel, Garcon is faster than 90-percent of the league's defensive backs. Long thought to have kicked the bucket fantasy-wise, the tender-footed wideout returned from the grave Turkey Day in Big D catching five passes (on 7 targets) for 93 yards, including a 59-yard touchdown. If he remains active, Garcon is easily Robert Griffin III's most reliable weapon. Aldrick Robinson, Santana Moss, Josh Morgan and Leonard Hankerson have routinely oozed Crisco from their hands, accounting for 14 combined drops. Mike Shanahan remarked Monday, the wideout escaped Week 12 without a setback and looked good in practice. Barring another misstep, he is slated to start versus New York, a game with major playoff implications. The Giants were sensational defensively against Green Bay, holding Aaron Rodgers and company at bay. Still, corner Corey Webster, who's conceded 17.0 yards per catch to his assignments this year, surrendered another explosive pass play, a 61-yard scoring strike to Jordy Nelson. Given Garcon's blazing speed and RGIII's affinity for throwing deep, Webster will again be lined up in the crosshairs, making the 'Skin a superb WR2 option in any sized league. For those that hung onto him, your patience is about to be rewarded."

S"What does a dude have to do to earn the fantasy community's respect? Wrestle a bear? Climb Kilimanjaro? Punch Norv Turner in the face? The Rodney Dangerfield All-Star continues to be the most underutilized player in the virtual game. Only owned in 60-percent of leagues and started in under half, many owners, idiotically, continue to give him the cold shoulder. If he played in a major market, say New York, undoubtedly longwinded soliloquies would be spewed about him. Save for a handful of WRs, there is no hotter target than Shorts. Over the past five weeks, he ranks No. 5 at the position in total points. Yes, he plays for Jacksonville, but with Chad Henne now at the helm, this is a very respectable passing attack that will continue to execute at a high level.  Because of the Jags' horrendous defense and unstable ground game, Mike Mularkey will again lean on Henne's arm.  Buffalo is highly susceptible between the tackles, but unless Jalen Parmele emulates Maurice Jones-Drew, the Jags may find it difficult moving the chains on the ground. With Justin Blackmon and Marcedes Lewis also searing, a pass-heavy game-plan is in the offing. After all, starting corners Stephon Gilmore and Leodis McKelvin have surrendered a combined 100.5 QB rating. Enough is enough. Start Shorts."

S"McCoy may look like he's perpetually 12-years old, but IF Brandon Weeden doesn't pass post-concussion tests with flying colors this week, the once hyped draft pick could notch manly numbers against the Raiders. For months rumors about a McCoy departure have swirled about Cleveland. Several teams, including the Green Bay Packers, allegedly expressed interest in the backup. Of course, no deal materialized, but Week 13 presents a unique opportunity for the signal caller to showcase his wares. If the overhauled Browns front office is committed to Weeden, surely McCoy will get shipped out, potentially landing in a locale that sorely needs a starting quarterback \xe2\x80\x94 *cough* \xe2\x80\x94 Arizona. Several NFL insiders believe he deserves a second chance. The numbers don't completely support that notion. In 21 career starts, he's compiled a pedestrian 74.5 QB rating (205.2 ypg, 20:20 td:int split). However,  in the appropriate system he could outperform expectations. Oakland is a spectacular matchup. Since Week 2 only Matt Cassel and Matt Ryan failed to score at least 21 standard fantasy points against the Raiders. Overall, they've given up 257.2 passing yards and 2.1 touchdowns per game, the fifth-most in the NFL. Worst yet, they've allowed three passing touchdowns in three consecutive weeks. If thrust into the starting lineup, McCoy won't spoil the opportunity. Debate his merits in deep leagues."

S'Truthfully, the respect I house for Martin is unparalleled. Entering the season, few fanalysts were more bullish on the rookie than yours truly. As predicted, he\'s taken advantage of a fantastic situation and then some. On pace for a remarkable 2,011 total yards and 14 touchdowns, his end season line may soon be the greatest achievement by a rookie rusher in NFL history, eclipsing the astonishing freshman campaign of Adrian Peterson. What\'s equally incredible, he\'s gripped the pigskin 37 fewer times than Arian Foster yet trails the position\'s current pacesetter by a tiny 3.1 fantasy points. Can you say "efficient?" Still, no running back, no matter how special, is completely immune from a letdown. When a daunting matchup looms the \'Always Start your Studs\' theory isn\'t foolproof. The Broncos have sniffed out the run terrifically this year. Von Miller is their bloodhound. The spectacled linebacker ranks No. 1 against the run regardless of position per Pro Football Focus. Collectively, only four rushers have crossed the chalk on the ground against Denver this year. And, overall, the Mile High Monsters have limited RBs to just 3.6 yards per carry. Martin will get his customary 20-23 touches, but in a hostile environment and given the strong odds Tampa will play from behind much of the day, he may resemble more Feeble Ferret than Muscle Hamster. Then again, the last time he was featured in this space he shattered team records.'

S"With former offensive coordinator Chris Palmer no longer in the picture, wholesale changes could be underway in Tennessee, a strategic shift that may not necessarily benefit Johnson. Promoted assistant Dowell Loggains greatly enhanced the production of Kerry Collins and Vince Young, a stunning feat of humanity, as quarterbacks coach/overseer of offensive quality control. His past successes support the belief Jake Locker could become the new point of emphasis in an offensive that has plenty of above average vertical weapons. Of course, this doesn't mean Tennessee will dramatically reduce Johnson's workload, but the 22.5 touches per game he received over the past four weeks may not be in the cards over the foreseeable future, particularly this week. Houston's defensive problems are deeply rooted in its secondary. Jonathan Joseph continues to deal with a tender hammy which has caused opponents to turn skyward. The loss of LB Brooks Reed is a major blow, but there is enough remaining talent to stamp out the rush. Plus, Wade Philips' 3-4 scheme is just that good. Voids up front are typically filled without a hitch. Houston's rush TD-less streak may have ended last week in Detroit, but a new one is slated to begin in Week 13. Keep in mind, the Texans have surrendered only 3.9 yards per carry and the fewest fantasy points to RBs. Yes, he went for 100-plus against Houston a few weeks ago, but expect CJ2Lame to make a cameo."

S"Given the humiliating state of Philly's secondary, do you think the Eagles front office sorely regrets dealing Asante Samuel? If not, they certainly should. The Falcons defensive back flexed shutdown muscle several times this season. Passers have tallied an uneventful 66.1 QB rating and top targets have averaged just 35.3 yards per game against him. As Dez Bryant, Larry Fitzgerald, Steve Smith and others have found out this season, the corner is one of the nastiest blanketers in the business. Colston has performed admirably for much of the season, netting 11.2 fantasy points in standard formats, the 13th-best total among WRs. But his No. 30 ranking in that category since Week 7 has left a lot to be desired, an unfortunate byproduct of New Orleans' spread-the-wealth system. In their first matchup Week 10, Colston's bland yardage afternoon (3-26) was saved by a touchdown. In the rematch, don't bank on him being as fortunate."

S"Growing up as a loud, generally obnoxious child in Central Illinois, my grandfather always told me to never judge a hooker by her boots. Or was it book by its cover? Whichever nugget of wisdom he imparted on me, it applies to Nelson's matchup in Week 13. Since his return from a pulled hammy three weeks ago, Nelson bared few fruits. His torching of Corey Webster in the first quarter last week at The Met was his first reception of 20-plus yards since Week 7. At first glance, most casual observers would automatically assume the Packer is poised for a major outburst. Minnesota, after all, has surrendered the ninth-most fantasy points to wide receivers over the past five weeks. But there are a pair of hindering forces acting against the target this week: 1) Greg Jennings is slated to return, 2) Antoine Winfield is damn good. Speaking to the former, Jennings, though he may be eased back in, is sure to cut into Jordy's workload. Prior to to his prolonged absence, he averaged 7.3 targets per game in three contests. As for the latter, Winfield has allowed a marginal 67.5 QB rating this year. Not only stiff against the run, he's occasionally smothered his assignments. Throw in Randall Cobb's growing role and Nelson's low target total over the past two weeks (9), and he's more WR3 material in Week 13."

S"If there's a television character that Gates best resembles it has to be Herschel from 'The Walking Dead.' Though intelligent, wily and generally tough, the graybeard looks like a rapidly aging player hopping around on a peg leg. Though 'healthy,' he isn't gaining wide separation from defenders like he used to, even when gifted favorable zones. Simply, the soft spots are there, he's just too slow to take advantage of them. His No. 32 ranking in pass rating per Pro Football Focus and shrinking per game output in traditional formats (5.3 over since Week 8) supports that observation. The man is not just in decline, he's sinking to the bottom of the ocean with lead weights strapped to his ankles. Due to its bracketing nature in downfield coverage, Cincy is exploitable across the middle. On the season, the Bengals have allowed 8.3 standard fantasy points against them, the 11th-most in the league. But it's extremely hard to trust a once unstoppable tight end in the advanced stages of rigor mortis."

S"In exhibition play, the anti-Akili Smith gave viewers a preview of greatness to come. With the exception of one rough series in Chicago, he displayed exceptional command, precision and pocket poise over three preseason games, finishing 20-for-31 (64.5 completion percentage) for 193 yards, two touchdowns and zero picks. Many would say counting on a rookie in his first professional start is akin to trusting Clint Eastwood to make a coherent speech on an enormous political stage, but RG3 is up to the task. The Saints, already a suspect unit pre-bounty fallout, are a very exploitable defense. Defensive end Will Smith and linebacker Jonathan Vilma, who were handed down multi-week vacations for their part in the scandal, won't be in attendance. Starting linebackers Curtis Lofton (ankle) and David Hawthorne (meniscus surgery) could also miss action. 'Nawlins, the 10th-most generous unit to QBs a season ago, will undoubtedly be one of the league's most matchup-friendly teams, especially early on. Add that to Drew Brees' indestructibility at home (328 ypg, 29:6 TD:INT in eight homes games last year), and it's likely a point-scoring bonanza occurs. A Cam Newton-esque debut is certainly within the realm of possibility. Eat fresh, gamers."

S"Maurice Jones-Drew, doing his best Chris Johnson impersonation, ended his holdout at the eleventh hour, reporting to Jags camp Sunday. What a party-crasher. Jennings, who looked every bit a three-down workhorse running with the first-team in preseason play, was on the fast-track toward fantasy stardom. The Jags offense, which resembled a rusted-out Yugo last year, is now a souped-up Ford Taurus. No longer vertically inept, it should execute at a respectable level. If that happens, Jennings should thrive during his one game audition. At 6-foot-1, 228-pounds, the Liberty product is a load to lasso. He's brutish between the tackles, versatile and, most importantly, extremely motivated. If Jennings explodes against Minnesota, he could earn additional touches in what will likely be a loose platoon once the incumbent gets up to full speed. LBs Chad Greenway, Erin Henderson and defensive tackle Kevin Williams were fairly stiff against the run last year, but were far from the impregnable fortress Minnesota was just two short years ago. Ten rushers scored at least 12 fantasy points against the Vikes in standard formats in 2011, up from four the year before . Opportunity knocks for Jennings. Don't expect him to spoil it."

S"Most members of the fantasy community harbor lukewarm feelings for Smith. His recurring ankle problems and fair speed leave a lot to be desired. But, when healthy, he's a skilled back who contributes solidly via ground and air. His 201 total yard, three-TD mauling of Carolina Week 11 was one of four double-digit performances in his seven games last year. With Mikel Leshoure out due to suspension and Jahvid Best on the PUP, he's the only game in town, tender wheel and all. St. Louis, historically vulnerable against the run, should undergo a culture change with Jeff Fisher, but don't expect an overnight turnaround. System implementation and talent-stocking take time. Some strides will be made, but this is a club that allowed 161.8 total yards per game to RBs a season ago, the sixth-most in the NFL. Make no mistake, Detroit is a pass-first, past-often club, but because of Smith's plus hands, he's a strong candidate for 3-5 catches per game, enhancing his worth in PPR leagues. In what should be a one-sided contest, expect the rusher to rack the points on roughly 15-20 touches. Employ him as a RB2 even in 10-team formats."

S"Blessed with the neck of Merton Hanks and the long strides of Herman Moore, Floyd is a gangling downfield weapon who, quietly, could be on the verge of a breakout campaign. Many publications talked up Vincent Brown and Robert Meachem pre-camp, but with the former out for the next several weeks due to a fractured ankle and the latter coming off a tepid preseason, the Chargers' No. 2 WR from 2011 is in an excellent position to build on last year's success. Though injuries have occasionally plagued him, Floyd has performed terrifically when off the trainer's table. His 9.6 per game average a season ago ranked No. 20 among wide receivers. Oakland's defense, particularly up front, appears much improved. Still, the overhauled secondary is loaded with question marks. Veteran corners Ronald Bartell and Shawntae Spencer, on paper, are marginal options. Weighing that and considering Ryan Mathews likely won't be in the backfield, despite his return to the non-contact portion of practice Monday, Norv Turner will lean heavily on Philip Rivers' arm Monday night, increasing Floyd's chances for a profitable week. Promote him to WR3 or FLEX in 12-team and deeper leagues."

S"The He-Man doppelganger has gained considerable momentum over the past couple weeks. Steve Smith's foot infection, minimal excitement over Brandon LaFell and Ron Rivera's bold prediction Olsen could be the next Rob Gronkowski or Jimmy Graham, moved the target's needle in late drafts. Those that played the patience game and nabbed the ex-Bear in the double-digit rounds could cash immediately. Linebackers Mason Foster, Lavonte David and Quincy Black are outmatched. Last season, Foster and Black ranked near the bottom of the league in pass coverage, together surrendering a near 80-percent catch rate. Look for offensive coordinator Rob Chudzinski, who was an instrumental force behind the rise of Antonio Gates in San Diego and Kellen Winslow in Cleveland, to attack Tampa's weakness. Olsen has always possessed the physical tools to be a star, but inconsistencies in route-running and the presence of Jeremy Shockey hindered him. Now with Shockey out of the picture, he should emerge as Cam's No. 2, attracting upwards of 7-9 targets per game. Coming off a standout camp and given the fantastic matchup, look for him to make a great first impression. Wield the Power Sword, deep leaguers."

S'In order to get a leg up in this business sometimes you have to be a little nutty. Attempting to read Lucifer Shanahan\'s innermost thoughts is usually a futile exercise, but it\'s possible Morris gets the first crack to establish himself as the \'Skins\' lead rusher. Tim Hightower was kicked to the curb last week, Roy Helu is slated for third-down duties and Evan Royster, though listed atop the team\'s initial depth-chart, could be the fallback option on early downs. Then again, who the hell knows. As Chris Cooley noted last year, everyone, even players in the locker-room, were routinely kept in the dark about the RB pecking order. If Morris nets the start, bank on him seizing the moment. Admittedly, the sixth-round rookie isn\'t anything special. He\'s tight-hipped, a suspect blocker and had a fumbling problem in college. But that\'s the beauty of a one-cut-and-go scheme. If you\'re an effective downhill runner with quality vision and break-tackle ability, you can succeed, provided you squeeze the rock. See Foster, Arian. As stated above, the Saints are hurting defensively. Key losses due to injury and suspension definitely favors Washington\'s above average offensive line. The Hogs will lead Morris to the trough. Recall last year, a healthier New Orleans team conceded 5.2 yards per carry to rushers. Because of its depleted state, that number could rise this season. Again, assuming he carves out a substantial role, expect "The Butler" to serve the Saints. (Or Evan Royster, Roy Helu, Olandis Gary, Tatum Bell, Maurice Clarett, He Hate Me ... whoever starts at RB for the \'Skins is a must play)'

S"Deep down if you really believe Manning, nearly 20 months removed from taking his last regular season snap, will suddenly display vintage form against the vaunted Pittsburgh Steelers defense, the Noise has a pallet of snake oil available for purchase. Full disclosure, I fully expect Manning to finish inside the QB top-12 this season, but early season expectations need to be tempered. As witnessed in preseason play (2:3 td:int split), he still needs to knock off the dust. Concerns over his lost arm strength have been greatly exaggerated, but don't be surprised if he relies on a dink-and-dunk style out of the gate, which plays perfectly into the hands of the Steelers. Pittsburgh may be aging in areas, but it's constrictive nature hasn't waned. It shouldn't be a surprise. Coordinator Dick LeBeau is a genius. And, when healthy, Troy Polamalu is seemingly omnipresent. Last year, despite injuries in key areas, Steely McBeam yielded a league low 5.6 yards per attempt and just 34 pass plays of 20-plus yards. Under the primetime lights, expect Manning to be mystified."

S"Because of  the high number of uncertainties at running back, Murray, sharpied in as the 'Boys primary rusher, experienced a major value spike in late drafts. Consistently going in the mid-second round over the first 2-3 weeks of August, he vaulted into the back half of Round 1 in a predominant amount of 12-team leagues, particularly PPR formats. The gushy feelings were justified. He's an explosive and versatile rusher who should net 18-22 touches per game. But don't expect the rising star to shine at the Meadowlands. The Giants' defensive strength is clearly in the trenches. Bookends Justin Tuck, Jason Pierre-Paul and Osi Umenyiora have always sniffed out the run incredibly well and man-eating tackle Linval Joseph is coming off a tremendous camp. Overall, the Giants' 4-3 is shaping up to be one of the league's stingiest. Look for it to feast on Dallas' very suspect offensive line, handicapping the rusher's value. On opening night, think of Murray only as more of a low-end RB2 in 12-team formats."

S'For much of the preseason, Gore resembled a sloth with an uncontrollable thyroid condition. He looked chunky, slow and Betty White-old. Though he remains atop the depth chart, he is far from the only game in town. Kendall Hunter, who was spectacular this summer, is breathing down his neck. Meanwhile, the Football Frankenstein Brandon Jacobs could poach goal-line touches and LaMichael James third-down work. It\'s a complicated backfield. Gore should net roughly 15 touches in his 2012 debut, but the matchup is far from favorable. Green Bay, which took a step back defensively last year, is out to regain its once sterling reputation. The defensive backfield is still littered with questions, but, up front, the Packers should regain their mojo. Clay Matthews is one of the league\'s finest run defenders. And B.J. Raji and A.J. Hawk should ramp it up after a disappointing 2011. Last year, the Pack conceded 4.5 yards per carry at Lambeau. Expect that number to drop dramatically starting Week 1. Gore "The Snore" is about to make a cameo.'

S"Last week, Wallace finally penned his name on the dotted line after the Steelers front office refused to waver on its sign or sit stance. Now in uniform and back in the classroom, he's quickly absorbed much of Todd Haley's playbook. But memorizing plays and executing them on the field are two entirely different animals. Champ Bailey is also a concern. Though the corner voted for Grover Cleveland, twice, he is still one of the league's preeminent shadows. A year ago, the Broncos allowed a mere 17 pass plays beyond 25 yards, the fourth-fewest in the NFL. Meanwhile, Bailey and fellow DB Chris Harris, ranked inside the top-15 in coverage according to Pro Football Focus. Yes, Wallace is a go-route guy, but without a single rep in preseason play, rust will be visible. And don't forget how the Champ clamp limited him in the playoffs last year (3-26-0). For one-week only, consider alternatives."

With a cushier bottom line and a tarnished image, he is out to prove he again belongs among the game's receiving elites. However, the Chihuahuas are slated to leave the Eagle grounded. Joe Haden, suspended four games after testing positive for Adderall, is currently in the appeals process, which should drag on beyond Week 1, making the shutdown corner available for the opener. If that scenario unfolds, Jackson will likely be in for a frustrating afternoon. A season ago Cleveland yielded just 43 pass plays of 20-plus yards, the second-fewest in the league. More impressively, Haden's assignments hauled in just 49.4-percent of their intended targets. Yes, it's possible the corner could stick on the more rounded Jeremy Maclin, but Sheldon Brown and Dimitri Patterson, both above average in coverage last year, are no pushovers. Add that to Jackson's one-dimensional makeup, and it could be a quiet week for the mouthy receiver."

S"The underrated swashbuckler has skewered opponents in recent weeks. On the hot seat earlier this season due to accuracy concerns, Freeman is back in his coaches' and the fantasy community's good graces. He's spread the love terrifically, slinging the rock downfield to playmakers Vincent Jackson and Mike Williams while checking down to powder keg Doug Martin when under duress. In his past three games, he's notched a 9:1 td:int split and averaged a ridiculous 9.7 yards per attempt and 336.7 yards per game. His subsequent 29.3 per game average is the second-best mark during that stretch. According to head coach Greg Schiano, Freeman's pre-snap recognition and the offensive line's rigid play are the primary reasons for the QB's sudden success. The Raiders have made strides versus the pass of late, coaxing five interceptions in their past three games. Still, only Michael Huff ranks above average in coverage according to Pro Football Focus. Don't expect Tampa's captain to run aground in Week 9."

S"For much of the season, Stew Beef's fantasy value has been locked away in cold storage. Immersed in a platoon with DeAngelo Williams and Mike Tolbert and routinely poached at the goal-line by Cam Newton, he hasn't received the quality touches he rightfully deserves. But finally designated the featured back prior to last week's battle in Chicago, he's a sure-fire RB2 moving forward. Though he failed to turn the Bears into a cabin rug (82 total yards, 0 tds), Stewart's 21 touches was the most action he received since Week 15 2010. Still with D-Will on the trade block and Ron Rivera determined to alleviate pressure on his quarterback, heavy workloads will remain consistent for the rusher. For the most part, Washington has defended the run marvelously this season. Only three RBs have eclipsed 12 fantasy points against them this season. But if Newton can stretch the defense effectively, which shouldn't be a problem given the 'Skins horrendous secondary, Stewart should see wide lanes to plow through. Add in his steady contributions in the pass game, and a line similar to what Jonathan Dwyer racked against Washington last week (118 tyds) is very possible. Uncage the kitty."

S"Many would agree, Leshoure is far from a Lesure thing any week. Complications stemming from a crowded backfield and, specific to last week, unknown physical setbacks have left a bitter taste in owner mouths. In a come-from-behind win against Seattle, the rusher exited stage left in the second half giving way to Joique Bell and, to a lesser extent, Kevin Smith. Post-game, head coach Jim Schwartz remarked injury was not responsible for Leshoure's absence instead citing Bell simply had the hotter hand. Questions are definitely raised, but, assuming he returns to full practice this week, count on the former Illini to bounce back quickly. The new Hello Kitties of the NFL, Jacksonville, have welcomed rushers with open arms. On the season, they've surrendered 4.3 yards per carry, 167.3 total yards per game and seven touchdowns to RBs, equal to the fifth-most fantasy points allowed. Some industry analysts have spoken poorly of Leshoure, but, when in the lineup, he's been rather productive. Since Week 6, he's notched a hefty 4.6 yards per carry. Now with the Lions offense clicking once again, he should be counted on as a RB2 in Week 9."

S"With only one touchdown on the season, Floyd's WR2 potential continues to live on the Dark Side of the Moon. Philip Rivers' excessive suckage coupled with Norv Turner's emphasis on the ground game have hindered his overall production. Even when presented with a favorable matchup, things haven't gone his way. Thanks to last Sunday's 'Frankenstorm,' windy and wet conditions in Cleveland largely kept his numbers in check (4-43-0). Despite his string of misfortunes, the wideout should be mass-started in Week 9. Against the punchless Chiefs, his luck is bound to change. Corners Brandon Flowers and Stanford Routt have yielded a combined 56.3 catch percentage this season. And six wideouts have surpassed the 10-point threshold against Kansas City this year. The short week and Rivers' persistent problems are a concern, but in a critical division game, expect Floyd to elevate his game. Yes, he only hauled in two receptions for 23 yards Week 4 at KC, but expect him to triple that output in the rematch."

S"Many thought Tate's value would rocket northward after his controversial TD 'reception' against Green Bay back in Week 3. But the opposite has been true. Russell Wilson's erratic play has made the receiver largely unreliable even in challenging formats. But fresh off one of his finest performances of the season (7-64-0 at DET), Tate is worth rolling the dice on in Week 9. Nearly benched in favor of Matt Flynn a couple weeks ago, Wilson has shown substantial improvement over the past three weeks. Ignoring his forgettable effort in San Fran Week 7, he's completed an impressive 68.9 percent of his attempts, netting 250 yards per game and a 6:3 td:int split over the past four weeks. Of his 80 attempts during that stretch, the passer looked Tate's direction 17 times, a fair but healthy amount. Another 6-8 targets seem likely against the Vikes. Minnesota's secondary took a huge hit, losing corner Chris Cook to a broken arm. For now the Vikes plan to institute a timeshare between rookie Josh Robinson and A.J. Jefferson to fill the void. Robinson has played adequately at times, but has allowed a 74.3 catch percentage. Meanwhile Jefferson, who was burned often as a Cardinal last season, has seen just six passes thrown his direction. With Wilson on the upswing and given the favorable individual matchup, Tate should be considered an upside WR3 in 12-team and deeper leagues this week."

S"The New Orleans Saints are fantasy's version of the Glory Hole. No, not the one commonly found in truck stops across the country, but rather the one gruff voiced Alaskan miners are convinced is full of golden riches. With pickaxe, and possibly the starting gig in hand, the rookie could soon strike it rich. Monday conflicting reports about an imminent change at QB in Philly emerged. Currently, only Andy Reid knows what number he'll call. Based on the southward turn Michael Vick and the entire team has taken of late, it would be no shock if Reid made a change. If Foles is gifted an opportunity, he could do his best RGIII impersonation on the bayou. An armless zombie could eat its way through the Saints' woeful secondary. New Orleans has given up a NFL-worst 9.0 yards per attempt and 27.2 fantasy points per game to passers. Foles impressed against New England and Cleveland regulars in preseason action completing nearly 64-percent of his passes while totaling four touchdowns. As the Piano Man discussed, the Eagles offense is a well-oiled machine. Though Foles pales in comparison athletically to Vick, he's a confident, poised passer who moves well in the pocket. It's always a risk to trust any inexperienced QB in his first start, but the Aints present an extraordinary opportunity."

S"Over the past three weeks, the king of consistency has donned a paper crown. Though his 337-1-2 output against Washington's ghastly secondary Week 7 was commendable, lackluster efforts at San Francisco (193-1-0) and last week at Dallas (192-0-1) surely left his fan-base dissatisfied. Now averaging a bland 20.5 points per game in standard formats, the 15th-best output among signal callers, he's far from a QB1 lock. Don't expect a sudden about face this week. Sans its leader Troy Polamalu, Pittsburgh doesn't resemble the Steel Curtain of year's past. The Steelers have recorded just 12 sacks on the season, the fifth-fewest in the NFL. Still, the secondary has executed fairly well outside Ike Taylor. In particular, safety Ryan Clark, who has allowed a lowly 23.1 QB rating this season, has routinely spooked opposing QBs. Though PIT has surrendered 11 passing touchdowns on the year, including a pair to Eli's older brother in Week 1, it's given up a mere 6.0 YPA and 192.4 passing yards per game. In fact, only Peyton and Carson Palmer surpassed the 20-point mark against it. Another week of miniature numbers could be in the offing for the Giant."

S"An offensive line without Carl Nicks is akin to U2 sans The Edge. Losing the mountain-moving guard, undoubtedly one of the league's premier run-blockers, is a crippling blow to Martin's rest of season value. Talk about bad timing. Everything was finally coming together for the rookie rusher. Over the past few weeks, the Bucs pass game and O-line had clearly clicked, opening up walrus wide holes for the youngster to burst through. His otherworldly 214 total yard, 2-TD performance last week in Minnesota was clear proof. It's hard to predict exactly how the Bucs offense will react to Nicks' absence, but this week's matchup was tough to begin with. The Raiders, widely believed to be softies between the tackles, have hardened of late. Over the past five weeks, Oakland has yielded just 3.4 yards per carry to RBs. And on the season hole plunger Richard Seymour ranks seventh against the run, regardless of defensive position, according to Pro Football Focus. Matt Shaughnessy, Rolando McClain and Philip Wheeler also rank highly. Martin's dynamite versatility and substantial workload are major turn-ons, but the opponent and departure of Nicks muddies his expected performance in O-Town."

S"When it comes to constructing an offensive game-plan, human Great Pumpkin, Romeo Crennel, is a master architect. At every critical turn, he knows the perfect play to call, maximizing his team's scoring performance. He's even fully aware of all personnel... Obviously, that viewpoint is the furthest from the truth. The clueless head coach, who offered no reason why Charles inexplicably registered just eight touches last week versus Oakland, would have difficulties organizing a two-car funeral. Offensive coordinator, Brian Daboll, would too. Beyond brainless, the Chiefs' best offensive player has seen only 51.6-percent of game snaps since Week 4. Presumably healthy, his dramatic misuse is perplexing. Because of KC's defensive and vertical shortcomings and with Peyton Hillis now healthy, it's very possible Charles won't log another 20-touch workload anytime soon. At this point, he shouldn't be labeled a top-10 or even a top-15 RB, including this week. San Diego ranks middle-of-the-pack in fantasy points allowed to RBs. Last week, Trent Richardson unplugged the Chargers piling up 134 yards and a TD on 25 touches. Still, they've yielded a mere 3.8 YPC to RBs on the season and have defended home field well. In what could be an ugly affair for the short-rested Chiefs, expect the JC of KC to notch devilish numbers. Be afraid."

S"For Julio owners, home is where the heartache is. Strangely, when performing under the bright lights of the Georgia Dome, the insanely talented wideout has disappeared. In three home contests, he's failed to find the end-zone and totaled a disappointing nine receptions for 107 yards. And two of those three letdowns came against exploitable opponents (CAR and OAK). Another vanishing act could be on the docket in primetime. Evident in last week's masterful containment of Victor Cruz and Hakeem Nicks, the Cowboys secondary is one of the league's most unforgiving. Though only adequate at corner, Dallas' strong play at safety explains its stinginess. On the year only Brandon Marshall and Brandon LaFell have tallied 10-plus fantasy points against the 'Boys. Jones' hand concerns are in the past and his  blend of size, speed and physicality is ridiculous, but don't be surprised if he produces only modest totals in Week 9."

S"Brandon Jacobs may be the original Football Frankenstein, but Graham is also deserving of such a moniker. The tight end is brutishly strong and soft-handed. When he's at full strength, it seems no amount of pitchforks or torches could take him down. But hampered by a nagging ankle injury, the receiving monster has rarely frightened the competition this season. In three of six games he failed to reach the 8-fantasy point mark. However, his 5-63-1 line last week in a humiliating beat-down at Denver was a step in the right direction. Still, given the tough matchup, there are no guarantees his Week 8 output will spark a scoring revival. Unlike previous years, the Eagles are very strong in coverage across the middle. Earlier this season, DeMeco Ryans and friends held position standouts Tony Gonzalez, Brandon Pettigrew, Heath Miller and Martellus Bennett to a combined 11 receptions and 100 yards without a touchdown. Graham could be the next to be kept under wraps."

With only 19 career starts at QB under his belt during his collegiate career at Texas A&M, most believed his learning curve would be steep. Naturally, the fantasy community underestimated him. Though still unpolished, the rookie has greatly exceeded expectation, showing measurable improvement from week to week. Smart and tough, he's displayed veteran acumen on pre-snap reads and stood poised in dirty pockets. His 78.2 passer rating isn't worth writing home about, but he hasn't committed a turnover since Week 4 and is coming off a rock solid 290-yard, 1-TD effort against the Colts. Another plus performance is on deck in Week 10. Tennessee, losers of two straight, is a team heading nowhere fast. Chris Johnson has found his groove, but, defensively, the Titans are a group of blind buffoons. Six quarterbacks have recorded multi-TD games against them in nine games, including 'His Smugness' Jay Cutler last week. Overall, they've yielded 7.9 yards per attempt and the sixth-most fantasy points to QBs this year. With Brian Hartline and the run game back on track, Miami, desperately trying to keep pace with New England in the AFC East, will dispose of the sliding Titans with ease. Yes, he only has two 20-point fantasy games this season, but, given the friendly matchup, count on Tannehill to play like a fish out of water."

S"Please Joe Vitt, set the man free. The fantasy community is begging you. Mysteriously parked for large portions of New Orleans' triumphant win over the Eagles Monday, the PT Bruiser, expected to take on an expanded role with Darren Sproles sidelined, saw his customary 35-40 percent of the snaps, ceding touches to Mark Ingram and little used fourth-stringer Chris Ivory. Of course when toting the rock, the yards after contact machine revved his engine totaling 70 yards on just eight touches. The coaching staff's underutilization of PT is beyond maddening. When fed often in the past (e.g. 2008/2009) he's delivered RB1 level numbers. He is more than capable of handling a 15-20 carry load. Still, even if he racks his usual 8-12 touches, he should prove useful this week in a pivotal division game against undefeated Atlanta. The Falcons, pounded often in the trenches, have given up 4.6 yards per carry and 4.4 receptions per game to RBs this season. Thomas, who is a snowplow between the tackles and a superb receiving back, should inflict heavy damage. The Saints' carousel at RB will continue, but the committee back is employable at the FLEX given the likely high-scoring affair."

S"On a club loaded with ballyhooed freshmen, Ballard's contributions might be the most overlooked. Since being inserted into the starting lineup three weeks ago, he's tallied meaningful stats, netting 5.1 yards per touch and a 11.1 points per game average in standard formats, the 19th-best mark during that stretch at the position. With Donald Brown likely sidelined by a hip injury, Ballard should again shoulder a burdensome workload. The new Hello Kitties of the NFL were declawed on the ground last week by the old, Detroit, surrendering 137.4 rushing yards and four ground scores to Mikel Leshoure and Joique Bell. Overall, only Buffalo, New Orleans and Tennessee have allowed more fantasy points to rushers. Ballard is a straight-ahead, downhill runner who won't juke dudes out of their shoes, but his quality yards after contact and better-than-advertised versatility should be problematic for Jacksonville's forgiving front, especially given Andrew Luck's influences. On short rest, count on the Colt to play like a stallion."

S"In what was supposed to be a breakthrough season for Antonio Brown, the wideout has flopped somewhat. His 84-998-2 pace is a far cry from the common 90-1200-8 projection many fantasy sites offered preseason. Now hobbled by a mild high-ankle sprain, the receiver's availability is in jeopardy for this week's friendly matchup against KC. Enter Sanders. In four career starts, the third-stringer has only posted modest results averaging 45.5 yards per game with zero touchdowns. Still, because of the added attention Mike Wallace draws, the wideout is an upside WR3 play in challenging formats. The basement-dwelling Chiefs continue to search for answers defensively, which they will probably never find. Defensive back Standford Routt was kicked to the curb earlier this week and Romeo Crennel rightfully stripped himself of defensive duties. The moves will likely make a minimal impact. On the year, KC has allowed 16.8 yards per catch to WRs, the highest mark in the league. Sanders isn't as explosive or as complete of a receiver compared to Brown, but he isn't a slouch either. On an expected 6-8 targets, he is very capable of tallying a starter-worthy line. If you're in dire straits for a WR3, give him a one-game audition."

S'During the Rams\' days of complete incompetence, receiving a pink slip from management usually spelled the end of one\'s career. If you weren\'t good enough for that busted franchise, you were barely UFL material. But for the fragile Alexander, his dismissal from the Gateway City swung open the door of opportunity. Picked up by the Chargers just over a week ago, he is already rebuilding his career. If he can stave off the pesky injury imp, he may make a significant fantasy impact, starting this week. Last week against the Chiefs, he caught three passes for 63 yards in his San Diego debut. Gifted a chance to showcase his wares with Robert Meachem and Eddie Royal down, he displayed excellent separation skills and athleticism versus KC, playing 37 of 52 snaps. Shockingly, his reconstructed knees didn\'t disintegrate. For now, Norv Turner plans for the receiver to "be a big part of what we do" moving forward. If slotted opposite Malcom Floyd Sunday, Alexander \'The Great\' could mow down Bucs like the conquerer did Persians. Tampa could be sans top corner Eric Wright, whose suspension is expected to be levied at any time. Even if he suits up, the secondary is extremely vulnerable. A whopping 10 wide receivers have surpassed 10 fantasy points against it this year. If you\'re trying to capture lightning in a bottle, snatch up the Charger.'

S"Blessed with a last name only a beaver could love, Woodhead is in prime position to gnaw on the competition in Week 10. Buffalo is a complete disaster defensively. Breaking the bank to acquire Mario Williams didn't do wonders. Routinely picked up and tossed about like rag dolls, the Bills' defensive front is unrivaled among AFC teams in their generosity. On the year, Buffalo has surrendered a staggering 5.3 yards per carry, 170.6 total yards per game and 12 touchdowns to rushers. Eight RBs have achieved 'Flame' status against them. Bill Beelzechick's revolving door at running back is hard to decipher, but it's becoming increasingly clear the pecking order is 1) Stevan Ridley, 2) Shane Vereen/Woodhead 3) Corey Dillon, 4) Marion Butts \xe2\x80\xa6 Brandon Bolden, who pounded the Bills in the teams' first meeting, has yet to return to practice. The diminutive rusher will likely only notch 20-25 snaps, but he's caught at least four passes in three straight and has received 6.0 rushing attempts per game overall. Assuming he's deployed similarly, he should finish with laudable numbers. Simply put, a corpulent Ewok could scoot it's way to a top-30 line against Buffalo. If you're strapped for options, flex him in deeper leagues."

S"Jerry Jones' illegitimate child, very similar to other NFC East passers not named Robert Griffin III, is the epitome of boom/bust. Despite being surrounded by several nuclear weapons \xe2\x80\x94 Miles Austin, Dez Bryant and Jason Witten \xe2\x80\x94 he only sports the 15th-best per game average in the virtual game among signal callers, ranking behind the likes of Andy Dalton and a white-hot Josh Freeman. Still, owners, like Jones, loyally stand by the passer's side sticking with him through thick and thin. The volume is appealing \xe2\x80\x94 he's on pace to chuck a career-high 636 attempts \xe2\x80\x94 but with only three multi-TD performances in eight starts, he's lacked in the scoring department. If play-calling 'genius' Jason Garrett installed a no-huddle offense, Romo would likely elevate his game. His mobility and ability to create would thrive in such a system. Unfortunately, it will likely be status quo in this week's clash in Philly. For the Eagles, a matchup with the Cowboys is their Waterloo. Win, and the angry mobs outside Andy Reid's office will temporarily subside. Lose, and guillotines will be erected. Expect the former to occur. Philly's talented secondary has at times underwhelmed, surrendering four 20-point fantasy performances to QBs in its past six games. But, overall, DRC and friends have allowed just 6.7 yards per attempt. Based on the matchup and given Romo's inconsistencies, he's completely unreliable in Week 10."

S"To hell with Lucifer Shanahan. There is no coach more diabolical than the orchestrator of Norv Nonsense, Mr. Turner. Speaking as a Mathews zealot, it's completely inconceivable how underutilized the rusher is. When healthy, he's San Diego's best offensive weapon, a player who can beat defenders via ground and air. Still, twisted Turner continues to lean on Ronnie Brown in most passing/hurry-up situations, a wrinkle that's pushed the Noise to the bottle ... repeatedly. Currently No. 21 in per game average among RBs, Mathews is Shonn Greene with fewer touchdowns. Still, he's a very talented player who will continue to log ample carries on early downs. However, it's unlikely this will be the week he reenters the circle of trust. Tampa is far from invincible against the run, but the difference between this year's club and last year's is night and day. The league's most generous run D a season ago, it now ranks nineteenth in fantasy points allowed to RBs. Only Alfred Morris and Adrian Peterson have surpassed the 75-yard rushing mark against Gerald McCoy and company this year. Given the difficult opponent, hostile environment and Mathews' diminished role, he is bench worthy in shallow formats. Sigh."

S"Just a few weeks ago Forte's season was at a crossroads. An ankle injury, originally reported as a high-ankle sprain, had supporters pushing the panic button. But the rusher quickly healed, easing the concerns of those who invested heavy coin in him. And his searing performance of late \xe2\x80\x94 his 148 total yards and a TD last week in now dry Nashville was his best fantasy effort of the season \xe2\x80\x94 has the Bear on the upswing. Over the past five weeks, he's compiled a 14.7 per game average in standard formats, the sixth-highest mark during that stretch. However, don't be surprised if Houston extinguishes the fire. The Texans have not conceded a rushing TD in 11 straight games, a streak stretching back to last season. Even after losing Brian Cushing in Week 5, they haven't skipped a beat. Overall, Houston has allowed the second-fewest fantasy points to RBs. Chris Johnson is the only rusher to surpass the 70-yard mark against it this year. Chicago's 'Smokey' is incredibly slippery and versatile, but in a galactic battle Sunday night, bearish totals could be in order."

S"Looking at Wallace's Week 10 opponent, the superficial observer would automatically forecast otherworldly numbers. The Chiefs, as Steve Spurrier recently discussed, would probably get steamrolled by a WAC school, let alone Alabama. Standford Routt's dismissal and Romeo Crennel's self-demotion as defensive czar are clear indications just how poorly this team has performed. KC has yielded the ninth-most fantasy points to RBs and the most yards per catch to WRs (16.8) this season. Still, as loony as it sounds, Wallace could underwhelm Monday night. Largely due to the exceptional play of Brandon Flowers, who has allowed a lowly 43.5 QB rating and 43.3 catch percentage, No. 1s have averaged a bland 46.7 receiving yards per game versus the Chiefs this year. Sans Antonio Brown, Wallace will garner added attention. It's entirely possible he will again fail to finish inside the position's top-24, an occurrence that's happened in three of his past five games. Combine that with KC's struggles against the run and high early blowout potential, and Wallace is prime position to disappoint."

S"To the game's most feared prizefighter, Peanut Tillman, Johnson has the look of Don Flamenco. The corner, who forced four fumbles last week in Tennessee, could land a knockout punch or three on Johnson, stymieing the receiver's fantasy production. Heading into this week, the Texan is one of the hottest targets in the league. Though he hasn't splashed six, he's reeled in 25 receptions for 278 yards over his past three games, displaying vintage form. The wideout credits a new practice regimen for his sudden resurgence. He's decreased his reps and logged ample time on the massage table in an attempt to stay healthy. Still, nothing could prepare him for the mental and physical anguish he'll likely endure in the Windy City. Tillman and Tim Jennings are the league's most suffocating defensive duo. Combined they've deflected 13 passes, totaled eight interceptions and allowed a 50.1 QB rating. Again, stifling. To be fair, WR1s have tallied a fair amount of success against Chicago this year, averaging 83.4 yards per game. But in what should be a low-scoring back-alley scrum Johnson will suffer a fate similar to what Calvin Johnson experienced at Soldier Field three weeks ago (11-3-34-0)."

S"When Foles hops on the subway in Philly, people probably mistake him for Napoleon Dynamite. The man is a dead-ringer. Foles, presumably a tetherball all-star, is also pretty good and slinging the pigskin. Filling the void for the injured Michael Vick last week in Tampa, he was absolutely spectacular. He completed 71% of his attempts, often feeding the ball crisply and accurately to downfield weapon DeSean Jackson, en route to 296 yards and three touchdowns. Improbably, the lumbering passer also 'sprinted' into the end-zone on a designed QB draw. His subsequent 33-fantasy point outburst ranked second only to Cam Newton among Week 6 signal callers. In a pivotal intradivisional game against rival Dallas, a similar outcome is in the offing. Due in large part to the poor play of Morris Claiborne (92.6 QB rating allowed) and Orlando Scandrick (67.7 catch-percentage allowed), the Cowboys rank No. 1 in most fantasy points surrendered to QBs. Sam Bradford (Week 3) is the only passer who failed to score 20 points in a game against them this year. On the season, they've conceded 7.9 yards per attempt, 329 passing yards per game and 15 total touchdowns to the position. Chip Kelly and Pat Shurmur were noncommittal earlier this week when asked who the starter will be. However, even though Vick suited up last week, the odds of the staff pushing his tender hammy appear long. Let the QB controversy begin."

S"Logging his first 100-yard game presumably since the Truman administration, the Football Frankenstein, a once fawned over man-crush, reanimated in Chicago. Yep, we all saw that coming. For a vanquished Giants team, Jacobs' monster night was a bit of positive news in an otherwise lost season. David Wilson, who fantasy pundits sold their souls for in drafts, never cashed in even when healthy. With Wilson sidelined an additional 3-4 weeks due to a neck injury and Da'Rel Scott also on the shelf, the geriatric back and youngster Michael Cox will shoulder the load at least until Andre Brown is activated off the PUP in Week 10. Jacobs, nursing a tender hamstring, isn't expected to practice much this week, but all signs point to another rigorous workload Monday night. If he again displays vintage burst and brawn and the Giants offensive line continues to execute, more top-flight numbers are likely. Currently, the Vikings are the most generous run defense in Fantasyland. Long gone are the days of the impenetrable Williams Wall. On the season, the Norsemen have allowed 158.8 total yards and 1.2 touchdowns per game to RBs. On another 20 or so carries, Jacobs should again flirt with the century mark in yardage."

S"A rolling beer keg of Guinness. That's what Stacy is. The 'stout' 5-foot-8, 220-pound RB is a hard-to-tackle ball of muscle reminiscent of throwback Natrone Means. He doesn't possess breakaway speed, but he does exhibit deceptive wiggle, solid hands and incredible interior strength. Since being elevated into a full-time role two weeks ago, he's averaged 5.1 yards per carry, gaining a ridiculous 63.1% of his yards after contact. Also getting more involved in the pass game, he could soon graduate from the FLEX-only ranks. His Week 7 matchup against Carolina presents a tall task. Charles Johnson and cohorts have yielded only one 70-yard RB (C.J. Spiller Week 2), two rushing touchdowns and 4.0 yards per carry to plowshares on the year. Still, Stacy is a lock for roughly 17-20 carries per week and is the featured goal-line rusher, evident in his six red-zone totes the past two games. Who knows what version of the Rams we'll see Sunday, but if there's one sure thing, it's Stacy blasting his way to another 75-plus yards. Hunch says, he'll finally find the end-zone too."

S"For those that scored Allen off waivers a couple weeks ago, congrats, you likely landed a top-15 wide receiver rest of season. The Cal product has quickly blossomed into a must-start option even in shallow formats. With Malcom Floyd toast, he's ascended to the top of the Chargers' depth-chart, hauling in 15 receptions (on 21 targets) for 222 yards and two touchdowns the past two weeks. What's most impressive about Allen's game isn't his electric play-making ability or separation skills, it's his route-running polish. The kid isn't a one-trick pony. As shown Monday night against Indy, he can run just about every route in the tree effectively and accurately. This week facing the Snagglepusses of the NFL, he should inflict heavy damage. Every member of the Jags secondary has surrendered at least a 92.0 QB rating and 61.0 catch rate to their assignments this year. And since Week 3, five WRs have surpassed the 10-point threshold against the unit. Stop thinking of Allen as some random bench commodity who's gotten lucky the past couple weeks. Given the matchup and his recent hot streak, he deserves to be started over the likes of Larry Fitzgerald (vs. Sea), Jordy Nelson (vs. Cle), Torrey Smith (at Pit) and 'Dumpster Fire' Dwayne Bowe (vs. Hou) in Week 7."

S"No surprise, the WR5 goes the way of Cam Newton. When the QB is firing on all cylinders, LaFell is a viable WR3. When not, and goose-eggs are a foregone conclusion. The former unfolded last week against a vulnerable Minnesota secondary. In that contest, LaFell put together his finest fantasy performance this season. Torching Josh Robinson on numerous occasions, he caught four passes for 107 yards and a touchdown. His 6.0 targets per game are a bit unnerving, but as long as Cam continues to scorch his chances of repeat success are better than you think. Outside of every secondary in the NFC East, the Rams' is arguably the league's most generous. Trumaine Johnson is the club's only DB with an above average pass coverage rating according to Pro Football Focus. Again, LaFell's smallish average workload amplifies the risk, but those with limited options at WR3 should confidently roll the dice. Keep in mind, St. Louis has given up the ninth-most fantasy points to wide receivers this season."

S"Seven years ago the Yahoo Fantasy community was rocked by an overlooked rookie with an unusual position designation. His name: Marques Colston. Labeled a 'tweener' by NFL scouts, he was assigned the ultra-rare WR/TE by Yahoo numbers provider Stats Inc., an eligibility tag that made owners' heads spin. In an age when tight end was about as deep as a kiddie pool, Colston proved incredibly valuable posting a 70-1038-8 line. Though Wright is barely a blip on most fanatics' radar, he is quietly following in the Saint's footsteps. Rising from the depths last week against Philly, Wright, an undrafted rookie from Rutgers, was the apple of Mike Glennon's eye. The green passer, down Mike Williams, looked Wright's way a season-high nine times, which resulted in seven receptions for 91 yards. The tight end would probably lose a footrace to Chunk from 'Goonies', but his skyward height (6-foot-4, 220-pounds) and trust of his former college coach Greg Schiano are major pluses. Given his position versatility and growing role, he's worth entertaining in challenging formats. Facing an Atlanta D that's allowed the sixth-most fantasy points to TEs this season, he could again finish with surprising numbers."

S"Most quarterbacks refocused and rejuvenated off a bye would be itching to get back on the field. However, sans his most explosive weapon (Julio Jones) and deep in a seemingly insurmountable hole, Ryan can't be feeling overly positive about the current state of his team. Roddy White, still extremely limited by ankle and hamstring woes, continues to be a major question mark and again without the services of Steven Jackson, Ryan is playing with a reduced arsenal. Tony Gonzalez is sure to attract at least 12-15 targets this week and beyond, but Harry Douglas has offered very little as a starter in the past (43.4 ypg, 1 TD in six career starts) and without Julio's ability to stretch the filed, the mid-range pass game is sure to struggle. Despite having the third-best cover corner in the league (per Pro Football Focus) in Darrelle Revis on roster, Tampa hasn't exactly grounded opposing passing attacks, evident in Nick Foles' phenomenal performance last week (296-3-0). Still, given the unappealing circumstances, Ryan is far from a must-start. The aforementioned Foles (vs. Dal), Philip Rivers (at Jax) and Eli Manning (vs. Min) are stronger plays."

S"Lynch is the definition of bull in a china shop. His unparalleled tenacity, violent running style and reliable durability practically make him matchup proof. But, as discussed previously, no commodity is immune from tallying sickly numbers. This week in the desert, don't expect Lynch to taste the rainbow. The Cardinals, without much fanfare, have been ferocious against the run. On the year, they've surrendered just 3.1 yards per carry and 50.2 rushing yards per game to opposing RB1s equal to the fourth-fewest fantasy points to the position. According to Pro Football Focus, Jasper Brinkley leads all linebackers in run defense totaling 16 stops on the season. Dishing out plenty of punishment at the UPS, they've also allowed just one 90-yard rusher in 14 straight home games. Suffice it to say, the Cards definitely crank up the defensive heat under the roof. Lynch, currently the No. 3 ranked RB in Fantasyland, has notched at least 10 fantasy points in four of six games. However, limited by a nagging hip injury and given the short week, he could be stuffed often Thursday night. Recall last season at Glendale he totaled 97 yards without a touchdown."

S"Trust Ridley against the stiffest run defense in the AFC and you'll surely sport a Rob Ryan face come week's end. Supposedly back on track after exploding for 110 total yards and two touchdowns on 21 touches (38 snaps), the Riddler finally rewarded owners who exercised patience. He displayed vintage interior toughness and, most importantly, secured the football, regaining the confidence of the coaching staff and fantasy community. With Shane Vereen still sidelined and Tom Brady struggling, it's clear Bill Belichick and Josh McDaniels will lean heavily on the ground game moving forward. Except for this week. Led by back snacker Damon Harrison, the Jets are an impenetrable fortress up front. No defense has conceded a lower yards per carry mark to RBs than New York (2.8). Overall, its given up the third-fewest fantasy points, holding RB1s to a mere 45.8 rushing yards per game. Recall Ridley only totaled 40 yards on 16 carries in their first rain-soaked meeting in Week 2. Anticipate similar numbers in the rematch."

S"Megatron a Lame? The leader of the Decepticons? Dude, that deserves an arm-mounted fusion cannon blast to the face. Admittedly, this is only the second time in Lames history Johnson has made the list (Sidebar: The first time didn't end pretty for yours truly), but owners should express some hesitancy before automatically assuming he's a must-start, especially in shallow leagues. Hampered by a knee injury last week, the decorated wideout operated as a decoy against Cleveland. Blanketed by cover extraordinaire Joe Haden in Cleveland, he managed just three receptions for 25 yards, averaging 0.86 yards per route run according to PFF. His appearance at practice Wednesday was a sign he's getting closer to full-strength, but in light of his situation and matchup, he's far from a WR1. Leon Hall, who returned to the lineup last week after missing two games with a hamstring pull, is one of the league's stingiest corners. His assignments have tallied just 8.5 yards per catch, the fifth-lowest YPC surrendered by a DB this season. More impressive, WR1s are averaging a lowly 44.1 yards per game against the Bengals this year. Yes, it's Calvin Johnson, but it would be no surprise if recent waiver wire gems Justin Blackmon (vs. SD), Keenan Allen (at Jax) and Terrance Williams (at Phi) outperform him in Week 7. Yep, HUEVOS."

S"Remove Boldin's off-the-hook Week 1 (13-208-1) and he's essentially Doug Baldwin. That's right, a minimally-owned third option in a run-first, run-often Seattle offense. Over the past four weeks, the receiver has racked just 42.6 yards per game, finding the end-zone only once. Colin Kaepernick's incredible inconsistency and San Fran's lack of a reliable WR2 are to blame. Unfortunately, a bounce-back seems highly unlikely in Week 7. Previously detailed in this space, the Titans secondary should be feared. According to PFF, Alterraun Verner and Jason McCourty rank top-10 in pass coverage. Verner especially has been lock-down. Targeted 32 times he's yielded just 11 receptions (34.4 catch%age), leading all corners in interceptions (4) and passes defended (8). Overall, WR1s are netting a disgusting 34.9 yards per game against the Titans, who rank No. 5 in fewest fantasy points allowed to receivers. Because of the difficult environment and Kaepernick's unreliability, Boldin is nothing more than a fringe WR3 in Week 7."

Holes the width of Lake Superior have become a regularity, allowing even the most marginal RBs to chew up large chunks of real estate. When Benny Cunningham tramples you for 100-plus yards, that says it all. On offense, Chicago is as spectacular as its defense is atrocious. With Matt Forte, Brandon Marshall, Alshon Jeffery and Martellus Bennett on roster, it\xe2\x80\x99s nearly impossible not to put up monster numbers in Marc Trestman\xe2\x80\x99s high-flying scheme. Just look at journeyman Josh McCown, a passer entering the year who hadn't eclipsed the 300-yard mark in a game since 2006, or when people actually gave two craps about 'American Idol.' Over the past two weeks, he\xe2\x80\x99s averaged 353.5 passing yards per game and totaled four passing touchdowns. Cutler told the Trib Monday he would be \xe2\x80\x9cpretty disappointed\xe2\x80\x9d if he wasn't active this week. Assuming he practices in-full Thursday, His Smugness should meet his goal. Against a decrepit Dallas secondary, which has yielded the most fantasy points to QBs this year, Cutler is in line to register his sixth 20-plus fantasy point performance in nine tries. If unavailable, McCown would be a clear-cut top-five option. (Cutler or McCown)"

S"Raked over the coals by local media and fantasy owners alike weeks ago, the wily veteran has staved off more explosive rookie Andre Ellington, posted suitable numbers and cemented his place as Bruce Arians' most trusted early-down/goal-line rusher (17 GL attempts this year). His totals haven't shaken Fantasyland, but with three touchdowns in his past five and 77.0 total yards per game in his past two, he's contributed FLEX-worthy production of late. Ellington (knee), who according to reports was nowhere close to suiting up last week, remains highly questionable for Sunday. Whether the youngster is available or not, Mendy should get his customary 14-16 touches against visiting St. Louis, an accommodating team against the run. On the year the Rams have surrendered 4.1 yards per carry, 99.3 rushing yards per game and 14 total touchdowns to RBs, equal to the fourth-most fantasy points allowed. With Carson Palmer excelling and the Arizona offensive line improving, he's a better option than you might think, especially if Ellington sits. Deck the Mendenhall in deeper leagues."

S"Most fantasy owners would rather re-experience fending off enraged soccer moms hell-bent on scoring a $4.50 waffle iron on Black Friday than put their championship hopes in the hands of an underachieving running back on the road in Pittsburgh. That's understandable. But Miller has a legitimate case. Sans Daniel Thomas last week against an unforgiving Jets defense, the popular sleeper RB in August drafts was finally given a hefty workload. He didn't post extraordinary numbers (85 total yards on 23 touches), but Joe Philbin's commitment in him as the bellcow foreshadowed the rusher's rest-of-season role. As discussed repeatedly in this space this season, the Steelers D has shown its age. Troy Polamalu and friends have allowed a laudable 3.97 yards per carry to RBs this year, but seven rushers have reached double-digits in weekly scoring against them, a very uncharacteristic outcome for an organization that historically hangs its hat on defense and ball control. Unless Mike Tomlin sweeps the leg on Miller runs near the sideline, count on the 'Fin to exceed expectations. Follow the volume."

S"If Edelman was a Dr. Seuss product he would definitely be a Thneed. He's a Fine-Something-That-All-Teams-Need. Ultra-versatile and highly useful, the underrated target has delivered sound production whether lined up in the slot (55.2% of the time) or out wide. Over the past two weeks, he's been targeted 23 times, catching 18 passes for 211 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Because of Joe Haden, many owners automatically shiver in their boots when they see 'Cleveland' on the docket. Yes, Haden has been solid, but as Antonio Brown and Cecil Shorts most recently proved, he's far from lock-down. So are the Browns' complementary DBs. Buster Skrine has yielded an 82.8 QB rating to his assignments. Meanwhile, Chris Owens was placed on injured reserve Tuesday, forcing the Browns to promote Julian Posey from the practice squad, a corner with two games of NFL experience. Hello, exploitable matchup. It's likely Haden will be shifted around, focusing a great deal of his attention on containing Rob Gronkowski. If that's the case, Edelman stands to benefit greatly. With the resurrection of Tom Brady in full-swing and given New England's rather unsubstantial ground game, the plucky weapon should generate high-end WR2 numbers in 12-teamers at home."

S"Barely surviving Tomlin's Cobra Kai move Thanksgiving night, Jones again proved valuable, particularly for those in leagues that score handsomely for return yardage. In standard formats, he's also turned a decent profit in consecutive games, totaling eight receptions (on 13 targets) for 156 yards and a touchdown. Because of his limitations as a short-to-intermediate weapon, Jones is wildly inconsistent. In eight games this season, he's surpassed the 10 fantasy point threshold twice. Normally, he isn't a recommended play, but Minnesota presents a unique situation. Torpedoed by injuries, the Vikings secondary has been picked apart in recent weeks. Since Week 8, it's surrendered the ninth-most fantasy points to wide receivers, including an historic 12-249-2 line to Alshon Jeffery last week. DBs Xavier Rhodes, Chris Cook and Robert Blanton have struggled, to say the least. Jones is very hit or miss, but if there was ever a week for him to nail the bull's eye, this is it."

S"Freak. Superhuman. Otherworldly. These are descriptions many close the Chargers organization have attached to Green during his first couple years in the league. Hanging in the shadows behind future HOFer Antonio Gates, the ex-Rajun Cajun has only flashed glimpses of his upside. Until now. Over the past three weeks, only Rob Gronkowski, Vernon Davis and Zach Ertz (thanks to Arizona's TE allergy) have outperformed the diamond in the rough. During that stretch, he\xe2\x80\x99s enticed 16 targets, caught nine passes for 206 yards and splashed the invisible pool twice. Most importantly, last week he played on 91% of the Chargers' snaps. Considering Antonio Gates is nowhere close to 100-percent and the fact San Diego features many two-TE sets, Green should continue to sit at the TE1 table for the foreseeable future. His Week 14 opponent, the New York Giants, have conceded the eighth-most fantasy points to tight ends on the year. If you\xe2\x80\x99re tired of inconsistent production at TE, Green is your guy."

S'Embarrassing. Humiliating. Sorrowful. No matter how you describe it, the Saints were handed their heads last Monday in Seattle. Dominated from gun-to-gun, they executed miserably on both sides of the ball, undeniably the club\'s worst performance in the Sean Payton era. But nothing heals wounds quicker than a little home cooking. In a game with major playoff-seeding implications, New Orleans\' "Dude," Rob Ryan, will crush white Russians, drop approximately 136 F-bombs and draw up a brilliant, attacking defensive game-plan to cool off one of the game\'s hottest QBs. Since Week 8 Cam has sailed past the 20-point fantasy mark five times, ranking No. 4 among signal callers during that stretch in per game average. A script copied from last season, he\'s again peaking at the right time, exhibiting improved accuracy and decision-making while moving the chains with his legs. He\'ll do some damage on the ground, but expect the Saints\' stiff secondary to keep him in check vertically. Only Matt Ryan, Jay Cutler and Russell Wilson have exceeded 200 passing yards and thrown for two or more touchdowns against \'Nawlins this year. Most discouraging, the fluer-de-lis has conceded a lowly 6.08 yards per pass attempt at home. This week, Superman gets exposed to kyrptonite.'

S"Despite his advanced age (30), in running back years, and high odometer reading, the king of consistency is on pace to post his seventh 1,000-yard campaign since 2006. Though running behind one of the league's most impenetrable offensive lines, he hasn't plowed over would-be tacklers similar to years past. He's averaged a meager 4.04 yards per carry and gained just 51.5% of his yards after contact, steep drop-offs from a season ago (4.71 ypc, 56.2 percent). Seattle has been a bit Jekyll/Hyde defending the run this season, evident in the midseason thumpings doled out by Zac Stacy (25-134-0) and Mike James (28-158-0). However, over the past three weeks the 'Hawks have sharpened their talons. Led by RB-eater Brandon Mebane, they've surrendered just 59.0 rushing yards per game, 4.02 yards per carry and zero touchdowns to plowshares. Gore, who totaled a wretched 30 yards on 10 touches Week 2 against Seattle, should shoulder a workload in range of 15-20 carries in the rematch. Still, searing off last week's utter annihilation of New Orleans, the 'Hawks D-line dominates."

S"The league leader in throbbing headaches and carries for one, zero or negative yards, has benefited greatly with Ryan Fitzpatrick under center. A featured check-down weapon for the veteran QB, he's complemented his rushing stats nicely with excitable numbers for the PPR masses. During that stretch, Johnson has averaged 4.53 yards per carry, 101.8 total yards and 3.6 receptions per game. He's also cut rug in the end-zone five times. Undoubtedly, he's more trustworthy now than earlier in the season, but this week's road trip to Mile High should have owners thinking twice. Though Von Miller has bolstered an already solid defensive line, the Broncos have allowed the ninth-most fantasy points to RBs since Week 8. Still, against Tennessee's stout secondary, I fully expect Knowshon Moreno and Montee Ball to be featured heavily this week, eating yards and clock at will. If Denver builds an early lead, Johnson could get lost in the shuffle. He's still a top-20 asset in PPR settings, but given the expected game-flow, Johnson could underachieve in standard formats."

S"The Denver pass game is the Price is Right 'Big Wheel' of fantasy. Spin it and you could land in the Showcase Showdown ... or back in the audience with a disgusted look on your face. Clearly shown in Eric Decker's four-touchdown scoregasm last week, the player that cashes big is highly unpredictable on a week-in, week-out basis. Based on the unfriendly matchup, however, I suspect those trusting Wes Welker, Julius Thomas and the Broncos' two-pronged rushing attack will walk away winners. Stated repeatedly in this space, Alterraun Verner and Jason McCourty makeup the wickedest secondary in the league. Combined they've surrendered a 49.1 catch rate and 59.0 QB rating to their assignments. Overall, WR1s are averaging just 44.4 yards per game against them. Most impressively, DeAndre Hopkins and Jerricho Cotchery are the only WRs to cross the chalk versus Tennessee the entire year. Nasty. The Titans have yet to face a passer the caliber of Peyton Manning, but with possible snow and game-time temps expected to be in the low 20s, the MVP frontrunner, who admits he has difficulty gripping the football in cold conditions, could get iced. Keep in mind since 2001, Peyton has totaled 212.3 yards per game and notched an 8:11 TD:INT split in nine career contests below 30 degrees at kickoff."

S"Forget the Hilton. Over the past several weeks, T.Y. has taken up residency at a rundown Days Inn in Gary, Ind. A prime example of Indy's offensive woes under Pep Hamilton, the explosive wideout has failed to ignite, netting an uncharacteristic 8.3 yards per catch and 42.7 yards per game since Week 11. Expect the mediocrity to continue. The Bengals have played extraordinarily well despite the loss of top cover man Leon Hall. Chris Crocker, Terrance Newman and, occasionally, Pacman Jones have filled the void nicely. Calvin Johnson, Josh Gordon and Keenan Allen each eclipsed the 100-yard mark against them, but in their past five contests they've yielded only two touchdowns and the third-fewest yards to the WR position. It's true Hilton has overcome difficult matchups before, but given the questionable state of the Colts offense it's extremely hard to trust him with the chips stacked. Book a room elsewhere."

S"The much-documented and discussed trials and tribulations at Redskins headquarters parallels the bitter divide down the street on Capitol Hill. Rumored disagreements between Daniel Snyder and the Shanahans over RGIII's usage combined with deep-rooted fan disdain for the state of the franchise as a whole has transformed a playoff team into the latest dysfunction junction. Though Shany likely has a one-way ticket out of town, his changing of the guard at QB was a sage decision. Cousins, in his first start of the season, exceeded expectations last week against Atlanta. Displaying solid pocket poise, improved reads and plus arm strength, the sophomore passer proved pivotal to those who stacked chips on No. 12. His 381-3-2 line ranked top-seven among Week 15 signal callers. Another stellar output is on the horizon. No defense has surrendered more fantasy points to QBs this season than the Cowboys. On the season, Brandon Carr and company have allowed 312.5 passing yards and 2.1 passing touchdowns per game. Heck, even flaccid-armed Matt Flynn rolled up four touchdowns on them. With his future to play for and because Washington's defense will presumably push him into a high-volume situation, Cousins is a sure-fire top-10 option this week."

S"Similar to gold bars, Furbys and Bitcoin, Jennings is worth a ton. Still, many owners idiotically continue to give him the cold shoulder each week, choosing to leave his statistical riches on the bench. It's time to get a clue, haters. The Silver Smasher needs to be in your championship lineup. Though dwarfed in his return by an historic Jamaal Charles performance, the rusher picked up where he left off, hanging 103 total yards and a pair of touchdowns on Kansas City last week. In six starts this season, he's netted 94.0 total yards per game and splashed pay-dirt five times. More impressive, from Weeks 9-15, only the JC of KC and LeSean McCoy have outperformed him in per game average among RBs. Back in Week 5, Jennings accounted for just 41 yards on 10 carries against San Diego. However, in the rematch, expect him to tote a more substantial workload (20-plus touches) and post beefier numbers. The Chargers run D played brilliantly last Thursday in Denver holding Knowshon Moreno and Montee Ball under 60 total yards, but, including that effort, they've still conceded 4.76 yards per carry and 134.2 total yards per game to RBs since Week 9. Ring the silver bell, trophy seekers."

S"One of my favorite rookies entering the season, Gio, as expected, increased his fantasy profile as the temperatures cooled. Blessed with drag-racer speed, nasty elusiveness and terrific versatility, he's a complete package who deserves to be taken in Round 2 of 12-team drafts next August. His execution down the homestretch has certainly boosted his overall value. Since Week 9, the UNC product has averaged 15.2 touches per game, 5.2 yards per carry, 80.8 total yards per game and found the end-zone four times. His subsequent 13.1 points per game average in standard leagues ranks No. 14 among RBs over that span. Bank on that number shrinking after this week. Minnesota has consistently been a pushover on the ground. On the year, the Purple People Greeters have conceded the eighth-most fantasy points to rushers. More encouraging for Gio, at least one RB has surpassed the 10-fantasy point threshold against them in 11 straight. Starting to distance himself from BenJarvus Green-Ellis and gifted a sensational matchup, he's must-start material at RB2 in all formats."

S'Victor Cruz, Hakeem Nicks and Randle, widely billed as a three-headed monster preseason, have actually played like a three-headed ferret. Nicks is still scoreless. Randle has offered little consistency. And Cruz, who hasn\'t passed the pylons since Week 4, is likely done for the year after suffering a concussion and knee injury last week. Overall, none rank inside the top-25 in per game average among WRs. Of course, much of the blame falls on Eli "The Magnet" Manning, but the Giants offensive line deserves a finger point or three. Under pressure 39.8% of the time, up 10-percent from last year, Eli has crumbled under the added heat, resulting in putrid production for his targets. Against Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley it\'s doubtful the QB will get a break. Still, there will be numerous pass attempts and someone will inevitably catch the ball. Sans Cruz, who enticed 8.7 targets per game this year, Randle is the most likely candidate to register a fantasy pulse for the G-Men. Possibly without the services of corner Chris Houston yet again, the Lions secondary, which has allowed the fourth-most fantasy points to wideouts on the season, is vulnerable. Since Week 4, 15 receivers have achieved \'Flames\' status against Detroit. On roughly 8-10 targets, look for Randle to sneak inside the WR top-24 this week.'

S"Sanders, lambasted repeatedly by the 'Fantasy Football Live' crew over the course of the season, has us wiping egg off our face. Over the past four weeks, the misjudged receiver has scored three times, averaging a decent 5.3 receptions and 47.5 yards per game, production good enough to rank him inside the WR top-30 over that stretch. Weather in Green Bay can be treacherous this time of year, but with sunshine and temperatures expected to reach a 'sweltering' 26 degrees Sunday, it shouldn't play a factor. The Packers wretched secondary, however, will. Since Week 9, only the Kansas City Chiefs have yielded more fantasy points to wide receivers than Green Bay. Regardless if he draws Sam Shields or Tramon Williams most often, Antonio Brown's tag-team partner has strong odds of finishing inside the position's top-30 yet again. Start him with confidence."

S"Chubby chase. That's what owners with FLEX spots should do on the waiver wire this week. Carolina's portly punisher is clearly second in the pecking order behind starter DeAngelo Williams, but he remains an integral contributor, particularly in goal-line packages. Though he's averaged an unexciting 8.2 touches per game, the modern day T.J. Duckett has crossed the chalk seven times, many of those scores coming against exploitable run defenses. New Orleans, ramrodded by Zac Stacy to the tune of 144 yards and a score in Week 15, presents another favorable opportunity for the rusher. Two weeks ago in the Crescent City, he managed just 29 total yards on five touches. However, the Saints are an entirely different team when forced on the road and outdoors. In seven games away from the Superdome, Sean Payton's club has surrendered 4.42 yards per carry, 136.4 rushing yards per game and seven ground scores to RBs. If 'Nawlins again trips out of the gate, expect a heavy one-two punch of Williams and Tolbert. I realize it's hard to trust a light-loaded rusher, but given the plus matchup and his defined goal-line role, he undoubtedly has double-digit upside. Don't be scurred."

S"To the cursory viewer, Brees is the object of fantasy perfection. After all, his superficial numbers are downright gaudy \xe2\x80\x93 4,500 passing yards, 34 touchdowns, 11 mutli-TD games, 10 games of 300-plus yards. However, further investigation reveals a passer plagued by split-brain syndrome. More road weakling than warrior, he's failed to eclipse 20-plus fantasy points in five of seven games away from the Superdome, several of those against meek competition (e.g. TB, NE, Chi, Atl, and StL). For Brees, home is not only where the heart is, it's the only place where his QB1 persona lives. His matchup at Carolina, similar to his forgettable trip to Seattle (147-1-0) three weeks ago, should have owners thinking twice. In a virtual game where guarantees rarely exist, fanatics with trophies at stake are encouraged to weigh alternatives. Brees lit up the Panthers two weeks ago in the Crescent City completing 71.4% of his passes for 313 yards and four scores, the only multi-TD passer the Panthers have allowed this season. However, Captain Munnerlyn and company are sure to return the favor. On the year, they've surrendered just 6.89 yards per attempt and the second-fewest fantasy points to quarterbacks. Whether it's the hotel beds, time-zone changes or unruly fans, something has cooled Brees on the road (11:7 TD:INT split in 7 games). In a game with enormous playoff implications, expect that trend to continue. With all the marbles on the line, Jay Cutler (at Phi), Kirk Cousins (vs. Dal) and Andy Dalton (vs. Min) are stronger recommendations."

S'Don\'t trust the Purple Hey-Zeus? This close to his birthday? Blasphemy! That\'s the reaction many will have seeing Peterson on this list, but facing a difficult matchup fresh only two weeks removed from suffering a midfoot sprain shouldn\'t have owners taking him for face value. Yes, it\'s true the bionic man\'s 75% is better than other RBs\' 100-percent, but one has to be concerned about his ability to tote his usual 20-25 carry workload. He has practiced lightly this week and Leslie Frazier said Monday he "anticipates" AP will be in uniform Sunday, however, there is no guarantee he will be driven into the ground if active. Even if he did log roughly 15-20 touches, Peterson may only inflict minimal damage. Cincinnati, desperate to secure a playoff berth, will do everything in its power to contain Minnesota\'s strength, which may not take much. The Bengals, with or without Geno Atkins, have defended the run stiffly this season. Matt Forte, Jonathan Franklin and Le\'Veon Bell are the only RBs to cross the chalk on the ground against them. In total, only five rushers have scored double-digit fantasy points versus Cincy. Overall, Marvin Lewis\' club has yielded a mere 3.74 yards per carry and the fifth-fewest fantasy points to the position. Peterson backers fortunate enough to survive his Round 1 derailment at Baltimore (7-13-0, 1-4-0), may not be so lucky this time around. In what could be a one-sided affair, game-flow could treat him unkindly.'

S"What can Brown do for you? Win you a title? Nope. Get injured? Quite possibly. Whizz in your eggnog? Most definitely. Due to Eli Manning's ongoing problem hitting the opposition square in the chest, Brown found no cracks to fit through last week against Seattle. Entering the week, he averaged just over 100 total yards per game in his previous five starts, falling into the end-zone three times. But against overloaded Seahawks boxes, he struggled mightily, combining for 26 yards on 15 touches. Detroit, unfortunately, won't offer much of a breather. After getting trampled by LeSean McCoy in the Blizzard Bowl, the Lions returned to their stalwart ways last Monday against the Ravens, bottling up Ray Rice and Bernard Pierce. The puke-worthy pair, as they've done throughout the season, ran into one brick wall after another tallying 77 yards on 19 carries. Take out the Philly game and Detroit has crushed the opposition between the hashmarks, surrendering just 3.39 yards per carry and 99.8 total yards per game to RBs. With the odds stacked against him, look elsewhere."

S"It's stunning how sorrowful the Texans seasons has been. Widely tabbed by pundits as the primary competitor to New England and Denver in August, their year turned south in a hurry. Catastrophic injuries to star talent (e.g. Arian Foster and Owen Daniels), frightening coaching staff health scares and lopsided losses \xe2\x80\x93 they've undoubtedly run the gamut of misfortune. However, despite the upheaval, Johnson, ever the reliable receiver, has contributed yet another 1,000-yard campaign, the seventh of his career. On paper, the multi-time All-Pro has a fantastic matchup. Denver has yielded 14 double-digit fantasy scorers in 14 games this year. Add that to the strong chance Houston will be in catch-up mode starting the second quarter and he's sure to emerge a Garbage Time All-Star. But don't necessarily buy that logic hook, line and sinker. With Case Keenum cooked, Matt Schaub reenters the equation, an unwanted prospect. Over Mr. Pick Six's past 110 attempts, he's completed just 57.2%. Couple that with corner Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie's suffocating ways (No. 5 in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus), and underachievement is entirely possible. In a game that could snowball quickly, don't assume Johnson will stuff your stocking with stats."

S"Events have gone awry for the future Hall of Famer in his swan song. Catastrophic injuries to key offensive players, most notably Julio Jones, matched with a forgiving defense quickly transformed the Falcons from Super Bowl contender to pretender. Still, posting top-seven numbers at his position, the tight end's production has slipped little. However, in the final regular season game at the 'Stick, the football ghosts of Ronnie Lott, Bill Romanowski and Ken Norton will combine forces with current great Patrick Willis to contain Gonzo. San Fran has unhinged a bit against TEs of late. Tim Wright and Luke Wilson each contributed top-10 lines against it. But, overall, the Niners have done an excellent job containing oversized targets. On the year, they've given up the fifth-fewest fantasy points to the position, including just six catches and 41 yards to pacesetter Jimmy Graham. Gonzo is certain to attract his usual 6-8 targets, but a mediocre effort is sure to follow."

S"In his 2013 debut, His Smugness looked like a brand new man in Marc Trestman's high-flying offense. Against a rock solid Cincinnati defense, he released the ball quickly, spread the wealth and, get this, wasn't sacked once, a development that surely delighted Bears fans. His 21.7 fantasy point day wasn't earth-shattering. It ranked No. 19 among Week 1 passers. Still it was certainly encouraging. This week, Cutler, hosting a Vikings defense dismantled by Matthew Stafford and the Lions last week, could achieve a statistical scorgasm. Corners Chris Cook, Josh Robinson and Xavier Rhodes yielded a combined 111.4 QB rating and 68.7 catch rate, burned repeatedly by their assignments. The trio, again dealing with one of the league's better receiving corps, could have skin that resembles the color of their uniforms from the bruises inflicted by Cutler and company. Brandon Marshall, Alshon Jeffery and especially Matt Forte, who could do his best Reggie Bush impersonation, will be a handful. If you're an unconfident Tony Romo owner, throw the Bear a bone."

S"It's no secret, Mathews and I have an open relationship. We're devoted to one another long-term, but feel it's not necessary to focus the man-love solely on one person. But when he flashes glimpses of his former 2011 self, as he did against Houston early on Monday night, it's difficult for me not to want to see him exclusively. Off a strong preseason, Mathews regained some face among prospective investors. Running behind an improved offensive line, his displayed vintage burst and strength between-the-tackles. Though he looked good on the Chargers opening drive Monday against Houston, his rest-of-game play left a lot to be desired. Again replaced by Ronnie Brown in no-huddle packages, he saw only 20 snaps (Brown 25). Apparently Nonsense Norv's specter has possessed the mind of Mike McCoy. Rumblings out of camp suggested a committee, but earning only 15 touches in a game the Chargers led three-plus quarters is a bit baffling. Even if he tallies a similar workload this week, Mathews should be deployed as a RB2 in 12-team leagues. Philly's defensive front greatly exceeded expectations against the 'Skins. Alfred Morris totaled just 3.8 yards per carry on 12 totes. Still, I have reservations the Eagles will continue to control the line of scrimmage. And it's very likely McCoy will emphasize the ground game to prevent his defense from getting gassed. Charger up."

S"Ten lousy carries for three yards. For the un-mathletic that calculates to an All-Pro-worthy 0.3 yards per carry. Depressingly, that's what Miller, a much hyped sleeper by yours truly, managed against a better-than-advertised Browns front. What the bloody hell?! Many over-reactive owners are already jumping ship on the once buzzy rusher. When prompted, naysayers will yell Daniel Thomas, who played only four fewer snaps than Miller Week 1, isn't going anywhere and the 'Fins offensive line, which ranked dead last in run-blocking last week, sorely misses four-time Pro Bowler Jake Long. Though they do have a point, it's only a matter of time before Miller asserts himself as Miami's go-to back. His cut-back ability, open-field speed and versatility are far superior. When the ball is in his hands, Thomas resembles a fat penguin. He's slow to the line, straight-forward and generally awful. Darren McFadden tallied a mere 2.8 yards per carry against the Colts last week, but the Raiders O-line will soon prove it's much worse than Miami's. And come year's end, Indy's flexible front will likely rank as one of the league's most generous versus RBs. To keep pace with New England, Joe Philbin must establish Miller. That doesn't happen soon and Brent Musburger opens up for Eminem on his next tour."

S"No Gronk? Check. Danny Amendola already down and out? You don't say. Shane Vereen dinged? Sadly. Zach Dudfeld Sudfeld and Kenbrell Thompkins still finding their way on the field? Hello Julian. Edelman, the least discussed Patriots target during the preseason, has officially entered must-start territory. Positively radiant last week against the Bills, the fifth-year vet was a surprising favorite of Tom Brady's near the goal-line. On nine targets, he finished with seven receptions, 79 yards and two touchdowns, equal to a top-seven Week 1 performance among WRs. With Amendola and Gronk inactive, the slippery underneath weapon will be heavily utilized. Thompkins, too, should net another notable workload (14 TGTs last week), but because he'll likely draw Antonio Cromartie, Brady will turn to the veteran. With rookies on the outside (Aaron Dobson is expected to play), Rex Ryan will certainly game-plan for Edelman underneath, possibly shadowing him with an extra safety. Still, the crafty receiver will be shifted around to create mismatches. Recall last week, he worked out of the slot only 31.4% of the time.  If he draws inexperienced corner Dee Milliner, who surrendered 16.3 yards per catch last week against the Bucs, on the wing he is sure to win many battles. Expect double-digit targets and plenty of PPR goodness en route to a top-15 fantasy day."

S"Watch the replay of Floyd's ridiculous one-handed grab last week against the Rams and you can see why he was a staple on draft day sleeper lists. No doubt, the 44-yard haul was the highlight of the week. Additional jaw-dropping plays are in Floyd's immediate future. Pass-happy coach Bruce Arians will likely dial up the long-distance plays this week against Detroit. The Lions secondary, a perpetual weakness, surrendered an unhealthy 8.4 yards per attempt to Christian Ponder. That's right, an 8.4 YPA to the middle man on the QB centipede (Blaine Gabbert is the unfortunate caboose). Corner Darius Slay was used and abused by Ponder and Jerome Simpson on numerous explosive pass plays, giving up a whopping 18.8 yards per catch. A more dangerous downfield threat compared to the egg-headed Viking, Floyd will feast when gifted single coverage. Coming off a sensational training camp, preseason and 6-4-82-0 effort in St. Louis, the Notre Dame product should take another step forward in what will be a breakout season. Activate him."

S"When the Vereen bombshell detonated in Fantasyland Monday, Ridley zealots immediately rejoiced. To them, their prized No. 2 pick, benched for a costly fumble against Buffalo, is destined to recapture the lead role. But they shouldn't automatically assume that will be the case. This is Bill Beelzechick after all, a sinister, indecipherable coach who could give two (expletive) what the fantasy populace believes he should do. Unlike Tom Coughlin in New York, the Hoodie has options at RB. LeGarrette Blount, though sluggish against the Bills, is a proven NFL commodity and little Leon Washington, even at 31, remains a reliable receiver out of the backfield. However, it's Bolden who could carry the flag for New England's newly formed committee, provided his knee ailment doesn't limit him. He did struggle with ball security in preseason play, but he didn't cough up the pill once on 67 touches last year as a rookie and averaged a laudable 4.9 yards per carry. Unlike the stone-handed Blount, he's also an adept pass-catcher. When presented with goal-line opportunities this week against the Jets, Bolden, not The Riddler, could net those opportunities. Deep leaguers seeking an upside FLEX play should entertain the passed over RB's services."

S"We all would love to be Wilson. Magazine model looks. Supreme intelligence. Multi-sport versatility. Wealth. Incredibly attractive significant other. If there was a 'Single White Female' remade for dudes, I would proudly play the part of Jennifer Jason Leigh. However, this week, my mantastic feelings toward Wilson are repressed. Though he performed quite well against a better-than-advertised Panthers defense in Week 1 (322-1-0-7), San Francisco presents a much stiffer challenge. No doubt, the Niners' secondary is the team's biggest weakness. Tarell Brown, Carlos Rogers and Nnamdi Asomugha were burned repeatedly by Aaron Rodgers, each ranking well-outside the top-40 in coverage according to Pro Football Focus. That's an occurrence that will typically happen to most DBs against Rodgers, but with Chris Culliver no longer in the fold, it raises SF fans' level of concern. Still, there's plenty of talent in the locker-room to be an above average unit, particularly against Seattle's unexciting WR corps. Combine that with a likely strong dose of Marshawn Lynch (Recall last year he eclipsed 100 yards twice against SF), and it could be a rather conservative afternoon for Wilson. Remember last year in two meetings against the division rival, he totaled a mere 6.6 yards per attempt and 166 combined yards per game. Carson Palmer, Terrelle Pryor and Eli Manning offer higher upside."

S'Tied to Tom Coughlin\'s doghouse, Wilson has consumed multiple bowls of Kibbles \'n Bits in recent days. Likely due to an innate fear of Cowboys (What else explains it?), the over-hyped rusher nearly got Eli Manning decapitated and fumbled twice last Sunday, egregious errors that led to his benching. With Andre Brown on the mend, Coughlin has limited options outside Wilson. Da\'Rel Scott flashed decent potential in relief of the incumbent, particularly as a receiver, but pales in comparison talent-wise. And recently re-signed Football Frankenstein, Brandon Jacobs, offers nothing more than pass protection/goal-line security. When asked Tuesday whether Wilson would draw the start in the Manning Bowl, the always curmudgeon Coughlin responded "We\'ll see." It\'s anyone\'s best guess who will trot onto the field with the first team, but after Scott suffered a minor knee injury in practice Wednesday, Wilson will likely be gifted a second chance. He should rack at least 15 total touches, but against a Denver defense that limited Baltimore rushers to just 2.8 yards per carry, he\'s the ultimate risk/reward play. If you have an iron stomach, entertain the idea of plugging in Rashard Mendenhall (vs. Det), Lamar Miller (at Ind) or DeAngelo Williams (at Buf) instead.'

S'Bill Belichick doesn\'t just serve up slices of humble pie, he stuffs it down failure\'s throats. Just ask Ridley. Last week in Buffalo, The Riddler lived up to his name. Benched after fumbling in the first half, he left his owners, who likely spent a pretty penny on his services just weeks ago, completely vexed. Shane Vereen\'s unfortunate downfall paves the way for Ridley to reascend, but given Beelzichick\'s track-record of deceit, that\'s far from a guarantee. However, the usually guarded head coach openly admitted Wednesday "we are going to need him." As stated before, The Hoodie has options at running back. LeGarrette Blount, Leon Washington and sleeper Brandon Bolden could form a RBBC of unknown distribution in short order. Tom Brady threw his support behind Ridley post-practice Tuesday, but it\'s not his call. It\'s entirely possible the rusher will be limited under 15 carries and supplanted at the goal-line by Bolden. The matchup also isn\'t entirely favorable. The Jets were pounded between-the-tackles last year, but stuffed the run effectively against Doug Martin and the Bucs last week, yielding just 2.6 yards per carry. Play it safe gamer. Find a suitable alternative.'

S"Coming off a top-20 performance in Week 1 (6-5-68-1), the Saints' Old Reliable is well on his way to his fourth-straight season with at least 80 receptions, 1,000 yards and seven touchdowns. However, the Buccaneers present no small task in Week 2. Darrelle Revis resembled his old self in his first game with Tampa. Against his former employer, the Jets, he played 55 snaps, was targeted four times and allowed just one reception. Sean Payton typically shifts his receivers around to maximize matchups, but it's entirely possible Revis will blanket Colston almost exclusively. That happens, and it's likely the cherished WR2 underwhelms, an outcome not unfamiliar to his owners. Recall last year, Colston scored eight fantasy points or less in standard settings eight times, one of those lackluster efforts against a then more accommodating Tampa secondary. Inconsistency is his norm. Play the odds."

S"Running back failures may have topped many league headlines Week 1, but Dez's disappearance in a favorable matchup against New York was equally soul-crushing. On eight targets, he hauled in just four receptions for 22 yards, ranking No. 78 among Week 1 WRs, one spot ahead of world-beater Marvin Jones. Most worrisome, the popular second-round pick rolled his foot under a Giants defender in the second half, an injury that generated a collective gasp from onlookers. Thankfully it was only a mild foot sprain. Though he's practiced this week and is expected to start, he's nowhere near 100% and is far from a WR1 slam dunk. Kansas City's secondary, which benefited from the grossly inept play of Blaine Gabbert, looked terrific last week. Underrated corner Brandon Flowers, one of the league's finer cover-men a season ago, conceded only 9.8 yards per catch and a 45.5 reception rate on 11 targets. Also taking into consideration Tony Romo's limited condition (ribs), Bryant could flounder for the second-consecutive week."

S"Often times this season, the Heatmiser's hand has matched the drapes, delivering on a number of fiery performances. Currently the No. 8 passer in per game average, he's quietly on pace for 4,577 yards and 29 touchdowns, a significant leap in overall production from his previous two seasons. Historically, the Browns have taken a bite out of the human candy cane. In five career clashes with the intrastate rival, Dalton has failed to reach the 20 fantasy point mark in standard leagues three times, including back in Week 4 (206-0-1-13). Still, even with Joe Haden on roster, the Browns are fairly vulnerable against the pass. Since Week 6, they've yielded 245.7 passing yards and 2.75 touchdowns per game to QBs. Haden had A.J. Green's number earlier this year, but Marvin Jones, Tyler Eifert and Giovani Bernard are more than capable of picking up the slack if the corner locks down again. Corners Buster Skrine (78.9 QB rating allowed) and Chris Owens (89.6) will definitely have their hands full. At home, Dalton avenges the Bengals' early season loss at Cleveland."

S'Clueless, brainless, dumbfounding \xe2\x80\x93 these are the adjectives that best describe Bruce Arians\' continued loyalty toward Rashard Mendenblah. Though he\'s dwarfed Mendy in every possible statistical category, Ellington continues to wear kid gloves. Arians, who professed he would get the rookie 20 touches last week against Houston, refused to remove the bubble wrap. On 13 touches, Ellington totaled a team-best 78 yards. Despite the RB\'s otherworldly 7.74 yards per touch, it appears Papa Bruce will remain overprotective. Post-game the head coach told reporters he thought Ellington\'s lacking workload was "plenty," a sign it\'s doubtful he\'ll exceed 15 touches this week. Still, he\'s highly capable of tallying a strong RB2 line in Week 11. Jacksonville, presumably on cloud nine after winning its first game of the season, remains a defense ripe for the picking. On the season, the Jags have surrendered 4.55 yards per carry, 160.4 total yards per game and 10 touchdowns to rushers, equal to the fourth-most fantasy points allowed. Given Ellington\'s remarkable explosiveness and versatility, he should be trusted on the road.'

S"If you have dreams of rolling in the green, count on Vereen. Out since Week 1 after undergoing surgery to repair a fractured wrist, New England's slasher has been cleared for takeoff. Getting plentiful reps in practice the past two weeks, he is expected to be available and highly active in a monster Monday night clash at Carolina. Stevan Ridley will remain the between-the-tackles grinder and primary goal-line option, but filling the 'joker' role, Vereen should net 12-15 touches per game moving forward. Because of the limited workload most shallow leaguers will likely bypass his services, but think of him as an Andre Ellington-type, an explosive rusher who will likely haul in 3-5 receptions and 60-80 total yards per game. The Panthers, who have allowed just 4.01 yards per carry, three total touchdowns and the sixth-fewest fantasy points to RBs on the season, are a daunting matchup. However, with Rob Gronkowski back in the fold and Tom Brady clicking once again, Vereen, who is very dangerous in space, will be a matchup nightmare for Ron Rivera and company. Carolina, burned often in the flat (6.5 receptions/game allowed to RBs), better beam the Bat signal."

S"First game back after a long road to recovery against an organization that you butted heads with multiple times before getting shipped out of town? And it's in front of a raucous home crowd that's counted down the days for your arrival? Hollywood couldn't have scripted it any better. Harvin, already amped to be returning to the field, will likely have extra adrenaline pumping through his veins Sunday. Though Adam Schefter reported Tuesday the receiver is expected to be on a snap count, he could be to wide receivers what Andre Brown was to running backs a week ago, a 'limited' player who gets far more run than what was originally anticipated. Yes, given the Vikings' dreadful state and incredibly friendly defense, the game could get out of hand quickly. Still, Russell Wilson is chomping at the bit to play with his new shiny toy. With that in mind and knowing how dreadful Josh Robinson has been in slot coverage this season (85.9 catch percentage allowed), Harvin will get numerous looks even if he sees only 30-35 snaps. If you're a card-carrying member of #TeamHuevos, he's worth the dice roll at WR3."

S"Earlier this season, fantasy owners pulled hamstrings sprinting to the wire to acquire Hopkins. Week 2 against an ultra-stiff Titans secondary he grabbed seven passes for 117 yards and a touchdown, the only receiver to surpass the century mark against Tennessee this year. But typical of most first-year players, he's offered little consistency since, scoring seven-plus fantasy points in his last seven games only once. However, if there was ever a week for the youngster to plow through the rookie wall, this is it. As Nick Foles proved two weeks ago, the Raiders are a bunch of pansies against the pass. Corners Mike Jenkins, Troy Porter and D.J. Hayden each rank outside the top-70 in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus. Since Week 6, Oakland has surrendered the fifth-most fantasy points to wide receivers. Case Keenum has obviously favored Andre Johnson since overtaking the starting gig, but he hasn't forgot about his fellow rookie. The two have combined for 7.0 targets, 4.0 receptions and 66.3 yards per game in three contests together. Given the favorable matchup, look for the Texans two-step to wreck havoc over Oakland."

S"To most novices, Brown, similar to the McRib, is a product from an unknown origin. Previously the third option on a then winless Jags club, he was only reserved for those in the deepest of leagues. However, with Justin Blackmon on hiatus, the hidden gem is worth unearthing. Cecil Shorts is unquestionably Chad Henne's primary option, but Brown, who's attracted nearly six targets and totaled 18.0 yards per catch since Week 6, could garner numerous looks this week. Expectations are Patrick Peterson will shadow Shorts almost exclusively, relegating Jerraud Powers to man Mike. Because Powers has struggled terribly in coverage this season (61.0 catch percentage, 99.5 QB rating allowed), Henne's secondary target will likely be lined up in the cross-hairs early and often. Toss in the always possible blowout factor, and the pride of Liberty could cash as a WR3 in 12-team and deeper leagues."

S"Thought to be a viable Super Bowl contender, the Falcons have crashed and burned, victimized by crippling injuries and a rancid defense. As a result, Ryan, widely perceived on Draft Day as a top-10 QB option, has fallen on hard times, slowly fading into the background at an overloaded position. Overall, he's the No. 13 ranked QB in per game average in standard settings, but his 18.5 per game output since Week 6 checks in at No. 24 among signal callers. Yack. On paper, Ryan's matchup against one-win Tampa is fairly favorable. Outside Darrelle Revis, the Bucs' secondary is a mishmash of mediocrity. Leonard Johnson and Jonathan Banks have allowed a combined 102.8 QB rating to their assignments this season. Overall, the Bucs have surrendered the ninth-most fantasy points to QBs. And back in Week 7, Ryan torched them for 273 yards and three touchdowns. However, Tony Gonzalez's availability remains cloudy due to a toe injury and, despite playing on 55-of-58 snaps, Roddy White continues to resemble an ironing board in human form \xe2\x80\x93 stiff and rigid. Add that to a nonexistent ground game, and Ryan has 'Lame' written all over him."

S"Lacy, taking on the appearance of a monster-truck tire preseason, was the butt of endless 'fat' jokes, another possible Alabama bust at RB. However, now lean, mean and pounding for the green, he's bowled over and through would-be tacklers with the strength of a raging bull. Since overtaking the lead role full-time in Week 5, he's averaged a healthy 4.3 yards per carry, 112.6 total yards per game and scored three touchdowns, production good enough to categorize him a RB1 in 12-team leagues during that stretch. However, outside overcoming a difficult matchup at Baltimore Week 6, Lacy has faced a string of favorable run defenses (Det, Cle, Min, Chi and Phi). His Week 11 tussle with a rejuvenated Giants front will be his toughest assignment in weeks. Blasted earlier this season, the G-Men have drowned rushers in a sea of blue the past five weeks. Marquee names Adrian Peterson, Matt Forte and LeSean McCoy generated only modest numbers against them. Over that span, they've surrendered just 3.13 yards per carry and 59.5 yards per game to RBs. With Scott Tolzien under center, Lacy will be the center of Mike McCarthy's game-plan. However, based on the unsavory matchup, expect an uncomfortable number of three-yard plods."

S"Preseason, fantasy pundits and novices alike were head over heels for Montee Ball. The Wisconsin product, who was compared to Terrell Davis by John Elway, was sure to distance himself from the veteran and buttery-fingered Ronnie Hillman in short order. Because of Knowshon's excellent pass-blocking skills, reliable hands and strong 2012 finish, yours truly and esteemed colleague Scott Pianowski refused to follow the flock. Nearly 900 total yards, nine touchdowns and a top-10 ranking later, we were right, for once. As much admiration I have for the guy, this week's matchup is a daunting one. Yes, the Chiefs have yet to face an offense the caliber of Denver's, but their defense is good, really good. LeSean McCoy, Chris Johnson and C.J. Spiller are the only rushers to register double-digit fantasy days against KC. Overall, the Lorax's bunch have given up just two touchdowns to the position in nine games. He'll still deliver quality numbers in PPR leagues, but given the opponent and the fact he's losing snaps to Ball, Moreno may suffer in standard settings."

S"Over the past two weeks, owners who booked a room at the Hilton were rewarded with an upgrade to the presidential suite. Picking up the slack left when Reggie Wayne suffered a season-ending knee injury, he's proven to be more than just a long-bomb specialist, grabbing 14 passes for 251 yards and three touchdowns. No doubt, Hilton, now drawing opponents' best cover man, has overachieved. He's run sharp routes, beaten press coverage and smothered toasted DBs in butter. Yes, he's been virtually unstoppable, but against arguably the nastiest secondary in the league, reality awaits. No defense has surrendered fewer fantasy points to wide receivers than Tennessee. On the year, it's given up only two wide receiver touchdowns and a pair of 80-yard receivers. Stifling. Alterraun Verner and Jason McCourty, who rank No. 2 and No. 9 respectively in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus, are relentless, tenacious ballhawks. Verner has been especially assaulting, allowing a 23.8 QB rating and 40.5 catch rate to his assignments. Hilton has overcome difficult matchups before, but with Trent Richardson scoring elsewhere, the Titans focus on the pass and squeeze the clamp."

S"Way too often this season the Giants' salsa man has packed little statistical spice. A function of Eli Manning's gross inconsistency, largely caused by an increase in pocket pressure (2012 pressure%age: 29.8, 2013: 41.9), Cruz has been the epitome of boom/bust this season. Six times this season, he's failed to surpass the nine-point fantasy mark in standard leagues. For the PPR masses, he's achieved 'Flame' status four times. With Clay Mathews back in action and bludgeoning opponents with a bowling ball, the Packers defense is finally starting to get healthy. However, likely down top corner Casey Heyward (hamstring) the secondary is still slowly recuperating. Still, Green Bay has defended the slot well this season. If it ratchets up pressure and keeps Eli flummoxed, odds are strong Cruz's string of bland performances extends to six."

S'Many fantasy owners believed preseason E.J. would stand for \xe2\x80\x9cEternal Junk.\xe2\x80\x9d His questionable downfield reads and progressions were bound to make him a magnet for turnovers. After all last year at Florida State, he too often showcased a gunslinger mentality, attempting to squeeze passes into tight windows. More judicious than originally thought, he\xe2\x80\x99s played well thus far. He\xe2\x80\x99s notched a 4:1 TD:INT split through three games and is on pace for 4,100-plus combined yards (3,764 passing, 405 rushing). Not too shabby. Doug Marrone hasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed him to play too loose, indicative in his 6.3 YPA. Given his inexperience, however, that\xe2\x80\x99s a positive development.

Keep in mind, though the Ravens largely held Matt Schaub in check (197 yards, 0:1 TD:INT), starting corner Lardarius Webb and Jimmy Smith surrendered 14 receptions on 18 targets. They are far from lock-down.'

S"With Ray Rice in street clothes, Pierce seized the starting reins last week versus Houston, sending Fantasyland into a tizzy. Unfortunately, he delivered only modest results, evident in his 24-65-1 line. The Baltimore offensive line, which ranks dead last in run-blocking according to Pro Football Focus, is mostly to blame for the mediocre numbers. Still, despite the unit's underachievement, Pierce is in line to again shoulder the lion's share for the Fighting Sweet Peas. Rice, who is making progress, is a giant question mark for Week 4. Against a Bills front line routinely thumped by the run, Pierce, assuming he starts, should finally find some breathing room. Through three games, Buffalo has yielded 4.6 yards per carry to opposing rushers. If Bilal Powell can chug his way to 149 yards, it's entirely conceivable Pierce will exceed the century mark as well. Keep in mind he's a YAC monster. Nearly 69% of his yards have come after initial contact. Anticipate top-15 numbers in Week 4. (UPDATE: According to Ravens insider Aaron Wilson, Ray Rice returned to practice Wednesday and is expected to suit up in Buffalo. It's undetermined whether or not he will start, but Pierce should still play a prominent role. In light of the news, I've adjusted my projection below.)"

S"Buckingham Palace. Questionable cuisine. Bad teeth. And now, a triumphant Le'Veon comeback. That's what England will be best known for. According to Jay Glazer, the rookie rusher, sidelined by a midfoot sprain since preseason Week 2, is on track to see his first regular season action this week across the pond. The Post-Gazette believes he may even start. Advertised heavily in Roto Arcade throughout the summer, the youngster is a bruising rusher who echoes the days of Jerome Bettis. Last year at Michigan State, he led all FBS rushers in yards after contact. He also possesses above average wiggle, plus hands and is a very adept pass blocker. Considering how underwhelming Jonathan Dwyer, Felix Jones and Isaac Redman have performed, he should be thrust into a healthy workload immediately. The offensive line, which ranks No. 18 in run-blocking per Pro Football Focus, remains suspect, but given the ultra-friendly matchup, he's worth deploying in the FLEX, at a minimum, in 12-team leagues. The Vikings' back-end issues on defense has greatly softened their defensive line, allowing rushers to trample them on a regular basis. Minnesota has surrendered 175.7 total yards per game and three TDs to rushers equal to the fourth-most fantasy points allowed. It's risky (Just ask Big Ben), but Bell is worth tolling in Week 4. (in London)"

S"Dez Bryant. Larry Fitzgerald. And Andre Johnson. What do they have in common? All currently rank behind Hartline among WRs. Small sample size, sure, but very quietly Miami's second fiddle has jammed working opposite Mike Wallace. In three games, he's logged an impressive 9.7 targets per game, catching 18 passes for 238 yards and two touchdowns, one more score than he tallied over 15 games last year. Though he's stormed out of the gates, many owners continue to pay little attention. How rude. Under new DC Rob Ryan, the Saints have stiffened defensively, particularly versus the pass. Julio Jones is the only receiver to surpass 10.0 fantasy points in standard formats against New Orleans this season. Corner Keenan Lewis, expected to be Hartline's primary shadow, has allowed just 8.7 yards per catch to his assignments this year. Still, despite what appears to be a difficult matchup on paper, volume talks. Expect the overlooked wideout to flash his mitts on Bourbon Street en route to a top-30 day."

S"When the Bears announced the hiring of Marc Trestman last spring, the buzz around Jeffery reached a crescendo. Several people in the fantasy community placed great expectations on the No. 2 in what was expected to be a pass-happy system. However, ranking outside the top-70 in per game average thus far, his value has hit a sour note. To say he's overdue would be a gross understatement. The second-year receiver has enticed a meaningful 7.0 targets per game but has worked primarily in the short-field, seen in his 8.0 yards per catch. More concerning, Martellus Bennett's arrival has impeded his growth as a red-zone weapon. Still, given the favorable matchup, he's worth employing as a WR3 in 12-team and deeper leagues. Corner Rashean Mathis, who was recently promoted to the starting lineup, is an upgrade over Darius Slay, but the entire Lions secondary remains average at best. With Brandon Marshall and Bennett drawing plenty of attention, this is the week Jeffery finally finds the end-zone."

S'Entering the year, many believed the Raiders would be the most anemic offense in the league, next to Jacksonville of course. Terrelle Pryor\'s flawed mechanics, relative inexperience, shoddy offensive line and marginal weapons was a perfect storm of suck. However, Oakland has proven naysayers wrong, averaging 351.3 total yards per game, the 13th-most in pro football. Pryor, especially, has opened eyes, extending plays, showcasing his versatility while delivering several accurate passes downfield (65.4 cmp%). After suffering a concussion late Monday in Denver, the signal caller must be cleared, but assuming he is, Streater could shock the world in Week 4. Though he\'s attracted just 5.3 targets per game, 31.2% of those looks have come on passes beyond 20 yards. Matched against arguably the friendliest secondary around, he should be lined up in the crosshairs often by either Pryor or Matt Flynn. Only the Bears, shockingly, have conceded more pass plays of 20-plus yards this season than Washington. Most spectacularly awful, corner David Amerson alone has yielded 28.4 yards per catch. Can you say "generous?" Bet on black.'

S"From a cursory view, the Average Joe would instantly place Luck on a high pedestal. It's the Jaguars after all, a team that would likely struggle against WAC competition. Fair assessment, sure, but Pep Hamilton is a staunch conservative. The offensive coordinator will continue to ride his pair of thoroughbred rushers, Ahmad Bradshaw and Trent Richardson, from pole-to-pole, transforming the second-year passer into more of a game-manager type. Despite gifted 20-points by oddsmakers in Vegas, the Jags were thumped in Seattle last week, failing to cover the enormous spread. Russell Wilson finished with 204 passing yards and four touchdowns, undeniably his finest performance this season. However, don't expect Luck to match the fellow sophomore's success. Last week against San Francisco, the Ponies called 'pass' just 41.8% of the time, an imbalance that will likely be common moving forward. Given the retooled offense, early blowout potential and the Jags' vulnerabilities defending the run (5.05 YPC allowed to RBs), Luck will be more Alex Smith (173-2-0-23 vs. Jax Week 1) than Wilson in Jacksonville. The crystal ball says another sub-200 yard passing day."

S'Without a touchdown on the season and two dreadful performances in the books, C.J. officially stands for "Complete Junk." Limited by a thigh injury last week that hindered his explosiveness, Spiller was practically a non-factor against the Jets. Touching the pill 11 times he totaled an abysmal 10 yards. Thought to be a lock for at least top-10 RB numbers, he ranks outside the top-30 in per game average, wallowing in the same cesspool as Maurice Jones-Drew. Most worrisome, Fred Jackson actually isn\'t a rotting corpse. The veteran has out-snapped (119 vs. 102) and out-played (5.3 ypc vs. 3.6 ypc) his tag-team partner this season. A more accomplished downhill runner by comparison, Jackson, for now, appears to be the better fit behind a revamped offensive line that\'s under-performed thus far. So much for partying until C.J. pukes. Don\'t expect a rapid turnaround this week against the Ravens. Though Baltimore\'s secondary has had its issues this season, Terrell Suggs and Haloti Ngata have stuffed the run beautifully thus far, each ranking top-10 against the rush according to Pro Football Focus. Against the likes of Trent Richardson and Arian Foster, they\'ve surrendered only 3.5 yards per carry, 65.3 total yards per game and zero touchdowns to RB1s. Expect the buy-low window to extend another week.'

S"Speaking as a proud Foster supporter, the running back has kindly left a flaming bag of poo at my doorstep too many times this season. Though he's ran fluidly and steadily improved in yards per carry each week (3.2, 4.2, 4.5), he's failed to top double-digits in standard leagues in two of three games. Ben Tate's ongoing presence (11.7 touches/game) and Foster's relatively small role in the pass game are the primary culprits. Still, because the Texans offensive line has stood tall \xe2\x80\x93 it ranks No. 5 in run-blocking according to PFF \xe2\x80\x93 brighter days are ahead, however, owners may be forced to take one more lump with Seattle in town. From start to finish, the 'Hawks have routinely dominated opponents, particularly in the trenches. Against DeAngelo Williams, Frank Gore and Maurice Jones-Drew, they conceded a lowly 3.0 yards per carry and 60.7 total yards per game. Due to the strength of the Seattle secondary and Gary Kubiak's dedication to the run, a heavy one-two punch of Foster-Tate is likely. Unfortunately, the 'Hawks interior line, anchored by man-eaters Brandon Mebane and Tony McDaniel, could lead to a ton of three-yard carries. Temper expectations."

S"In the Big Apple, it's the Giants, and shockingly not the Jets, who've blown goats thus far. The G-Men's once rigid offensive line has softened causing Eli Manning to crumble under pressure. Already this season, he's experienced duress on 53 drop-backs, the third-most in the league and nearly a third what he tallied in the category over 16 games last year. As a result, he's shriveled in those situations, indicative in his 47.5 completion rate. Without adequate pocket time for Eli, Nicks has struggled to gain footing. He's a big-play receiver who needs an upright QB to feed him the football. No surprise, the trickle-down impact on his numbers has been dramatic. On just 16 targets, he's averaged 3.0 receptions and 65.7 yards per game. Worse yet, he hasn't shown off his dance skills in the end-zone. That trend, sadly, will likely continue. KC's best cover-man Brandon Flowers is nowhere near 100% dealing with a nagging knee injury, but the Chiefs secondary is rather unyielding with or without him. Combined corner Sean Smith and safety Eric Berry have allowed a 42.8 catch%age on 28 targets. Add that with KC's relentless pass rush spearheaded by sack-master Justin Houston, and Nicks isn't a trustworthy option in shallow formats."

S'When Gonzalez entered the league in 1997, Chuck Norris was still round-housing fools on "Walker: Texas Ranger." That was quite some time ago. It\'s possible Father Time is finally catching up to the future Hall of Famer in his swan song. Though he\'s still attracted a team-high four red-zone targets, his role has marginalized. Overall, his 11-93-1 line ranks outside the top-20 at his position. I\'m firmly convinced the TDs will eventually come, but it seems unlikely he\'ll replicate the yardage total from last year. The Pats haven\'t faced a TE the caliber of Gonzo \xe2\x80\x93 so far they faced Scott Chandler, Kellen Winslow and Nate Byham \xe2\x80\x93 but better than advertised against the pass, particularly across the middle, his numbers may again suffer. Yes, he\'ll eventually rebound (A healthy Roddy White would help immensely) but this week Julius Thomas (vs. Phi), Martellus Bennett (at Det) and Jared Cook (vs. SF), players owners have previously sat for Gonzalez, are stronger plays.'

S"Playboy's Girls of the Pac-12. Las Vegas buffets. And an unstoppable scoring juggernaut versus arguably the worst franchise since the '76 Buccaneers. The common thread? Incredible spreads. With statistical stomach bile Blaine Gabbert reportedly expected to miss extended time after hearing his hammy pop last week in St. Louis, Henne will remove his bifocals, tear away his suit and take flight in Denver. That is, from a numbers perspective. Jacksonville, the biggest underdog in NFL history at 28 points, has no fighting chance of winning Sunday, but it could back-door its way into the hearts of gambling enthusiasts. Going from Gabbert to Henne is akin to trading in your totally dysfunctional 2001 Pontiac Aztek for an operable 2001 Pontiac Aztek. The elevated backup is nothing more than a serviceable QB, but given the unusual circumstances he could be the perfect bye-week remedy for Matt Ryan owners. Masked by Denver's unmerciful offense, the Broncos defense is sorely lacking, particularly against the pass. Opposing QBs have compiled 365.4 passing yards, 2.0 passing touchdowns and 8.8 yards per attempt against them equal to the fourth-most fantasy points allowed. Likely to be buried early, Henne, who now has Justin Blackmon back in the mix, will smell like a rose in garbage time. Outscored 99-to-18 in the first half, the Jags will need to throw, throw, throw to remain even remotely competitive. A top-10 performance is no joke."

S"On last Sunday's 'Fantasy Football Live' #RollinBlount lit up our Twitter feed. LaGarrette Blount's projected 20-carry workload against the Bengals had many in Fantasyland buzzing. Unfortunately, a critical fumble in the second-quarter led Blount to bunk numbers. From that moment on, Bolden seized the reins and squashed concerns about his tender knee. Showcasing excellent versatility and downhill burst, he dominated snaps and workload in the second half finishing with 64 yards on 11 touches (six receptions). With Blount possibly in the doghouse and Stevan Ridley (knee), who did return to practice Wednesday, potentially limited, it may finally be Bolden's time to shine. Averaging a ridiculous 6.8 yards per touch, he deserves an extended look. Regardless how hefty (or light) the workload, the rising backup is flexy sexy at a minimum this week versus New Orleans. Compared to years past, the Saints, overall, are stiffer on defense, but they have continued to struggle containing the run. Rushers have netted 4.9 yards per carry against them. Defensive end Cameron Jordan is the only Saints player that ranks top-25 against the run according to Pro Football Focus' metrics. Because of his multidimensional skill set, presumed increased role and enticing matchup, Bolden could very well be a breakthrough star in Week 6."

S"Thought to be zombified given his advanced age and uneventful preseason, Jackson was supposed to take a backseat to the younger, allegedly more electric C.J. Spiller. However, the geriatric back has once again proven skeptics wrong, dominating the young whippersnapper in just about every facet of the game. To be fair to Spiller, an ankle injury has limited him the past couple weeks, but even when C.J.'s been healthy, Jackson has displayed more interior brawn, softer hands and a stronger goal-line drive. His 13.8 per game average in standard settings (17.0 in PPR) ranks top-10 among RBs. Still, the masses, always slow the take, have yet to truly embrace the resurgence, evident in F-Jax's low start%age. Get him in your lineup. Down E.J. Manuel and with inexperienced passer Thaddeus Lewis under center, Jackson and Spiller will be overworked. Roughly 16-20 touches apiece are likely. The Bengals have been fairly stiff against the run. Only one rusher has reached the 60-yard mark on the ground against Cincy this year. It's also allowed only 3.8 yards per carry to RBs. But because of his versatility and expected sizable workload, Jackson should be viewed as a trustworthy RB2 in Week 6."

S"To say the Buccaneers are an offensive mess is like declaring Scarlett Johansson the 'Sexiest Woman Alive' \xe2\x80\x93 incredibly obvious. Their opening week quarterback, Josh Freeman, flew north for the winter, Doug Martin can't find a hole anywhere and their head coach is so stern, he probably would've intimidated Joesph Stalin. Despite the Bucs' downward trend, Williams is an upside WR3 in Week 6. Remember, no matter how dire the circumstances, fantasy boils down to matchups. And Philly is a quite favorable one. No secondary, not even San Diego's, has been more generous to opposing wideouts than the Eagles'. Through six weeks, eight wide receivers have scored at least 10 fantasy points against it. Brandon Boykin is the only Philly corner to rank inside the top-50 in pass coverage. Givers Cary Williams and Bradley Fletcher have surrendered a combined 61.5 catch%age. Yes, it's Mike Glennon, but the extra prep time during the bye week can only help. Recall prior to the bye Williams hauled in four catches (on six targets) for 38 yards and a TD against Arizona. Off the one-week siesta he should again deliver at least a WR3 line."

S"Vincent, it's about damn time. Talked up repeatedly by the 'expert' community over the past couple seasons, Brown is finally starting to pay dividends. Last week in Oakland, he put together the finest game of his pro career. Targeted nine times for the second straight week, he hauled in eight receptions for 117 yards. Keenan Allen, deservedly, has generated enormous pub after his break out effort in the same game. This week, however, Brown will likely be the more reliable of the two. Echoing the Cover 2 days under Tony Dungy, the Colts defense has surrendered few explosive pass plays. On the season, it's allowed 15 20-yard passes, the sixth-fewest in the league. Because Brown typically operates underneath, he should shoulder a burdensome 8-11 target workload Monday night. Assuming he logs that many looks, a top-30 effort in PPR is an inevitability. Keep in mind a number of short-field receivers have achieved fruitful numbers against the Colts this season. Slide him in."

S"Garbage. Time. All. Star. Behind the soon-to-be Brock Osweiler-led Denver attack that's what the backup RB will be. As most expected, Hillman, who sat atop the Broncos' depth-chart for much of training camp and preseason, has fallen out of favor, losing touches to Knowshon Moreno, not Montee Ball. Despite his reduced role, he appears locked in as Denver's primary RB2, earning action on a series here and there. Over the past three weeks he's played at least 23 snaps in every game, netting 11.3 touches and 64.7 total yards per game. Considering the 'Spread Bowl's' expected lopsided score, it's entirely possible Hillman logs his highest touch total to date. No surprise, the Jags are woefully despondent in every defensive category imaginable, especially defending the run. On the year, Jacksonville has yielded 4.9 yards per carry and the 10th-most fantasy points to running backs. Given the unique situation, Hillman, and to a certain extent Ball, could churn out top-30 lines salting away the clock. If you need an attractive flex play, roll the dice on the backup."

S"Remove Megatron from the equation would make the Decepticons extremely vulnerable. Remove the football version of the same name from the Lions and you're left with Kris Durham, Ryan Broyles and Pat Edwards at WR. Watch out Autobots. Without Calvin Johnson last week, the Detroit offense was absolutely abysmal. Reggie Bush and Joique Bell, who normally operate freely in the short-field, were swarmed under repeatedly by Green Bay's suffocating defense. No surprise, Stafford's numbers suffered. Saved by a garbage-time TD to Durham, he finished with a mediocre 262 yards and a touchdown. With or without Calvin, who is a full-blown game-time decision per Adam Schefter, an equally marginal outcome is likely for the signal caller in Week 6. The surging Browns have thrived largely due to their defense, particularly in the secondary. Blanket corner Joe Haden has held assignments to just 9.4 yards per catch, surrendering a catch%age of 47.4. Mike Wallace, Torrey Smith and A.J. Green failed to reach 86 yards against him. Couple that with Cleveland's stout run D, suitable pass rush and hometown backing, and bland numbers are in the offing for Stafford. Keep in mind the Dogs have yet to allow a multi-TD passer this season."

S"The mailman, crappy reality TV shows and Frank Gore \xe2\x80\x93 these are some of life's greatest consistencies. Every year fantasy pundits predict the rusher's demise. And every year they're forced to eat a large plate of crow. Despite his high odometer reading, the Niner continues to dole out punishment. Churning his legs behind one of the finest offensive lines in the league, he's smashed his way to 12.2 fantasy points per game in standard formats, the 13th-best mark among RBs. Though he's looked terrific in consecutive games, Gore 'The Snore' could sleepwalk through Week 6. Arizona's defensive line is the most unyielding in the league against the run. No unit has conceded fewer fantasy points to RBs. On the year, opposing rushers are averaging a yack-worthy 2.9 yards per carry and 56.6 rushing yards per game against it. Late-game exhaustion is a concern, particularly if Arizona gets buried early, but expect Calais Campbell and friends to stonewall the Gamorrean lookalike (NERD ALERT!) often."

S"It takes elephant-sized HUEVOS to feature the No. 3 ranked fantasy RB in this space, but the 'Fake' McCoy could make a guest appearance this week. Sans Michael Vick, the Eagles offense should sport a different look under second-year backup Nick Foles. The pace will remain frenetic, but the read-option will almost certainly be scrapped, allowing the Buccaneers to focus their attention on containing Shady. It's been a circus in Tampa the past few weeks, but, fresh off the bye, The Dictator's club will be more than ready. Even on a normal week, the Bucs have defended the run extremely well. No running back has crossed the chalk against them and they've allowed a mere 50.8 total yards per game and 3.7 yards per carry to RB1s. Gerald McCoy and ex-Illini Akeem Spence rank inside the top-20 stuffing the run per Pro Football Focus. McCoy could juke a werewolf in a phone booth, but criminally underutilized in the pass game, one has to wonder how effective he will be given the difficult road matchup."

S"Outside the grating scream unleashed by Lloyd Christmas, there is nothing more annoying than backward thinkers who constantly remind fantasy players to 'Always start your studs.' The definition of a stud is far too broad. All players, no matter how consistent or reliable, are susceptible to down weeks. In a matchup-based game, underwhelming performances are bound to happen. Unfortunately for Arizona's top weapon downswings have become a common occurrence, tarnishing his must-start reputation. Currently ranked No. 28 in per game average among WRs, Fitz has yet to find a statistical oasis in the desert. 'Zona's shoddy offensive line has crippled Carson Palmer and the pass game. Palmer has been placed under pressure 38.3% of the time, completing just 45.9 percent of his attempts with the cooker on high. As a result, Fitz has netted six targets or less in three of five games and has yet to surpass the 85-yard mark this season. San Fran's aggressive pass rush and stiff secondary (third-fewest fantasy points allowed to WRs) is a recipe for fantasy disaster. Though his track-record against the Niners is quite good (18 games, 75.6 ypg, 11 TDs), the smart gamer would sit the supposed 'stud.'"

S"Colston is a dice roll in Monopoly personified. Sometimes you land on Boardwalk. Most times you take up residence on Baltic Avenue. A true king of inconsistency, the Saints wideout has rarely found the end-zone this year, totaling a big fat bagel in the category since Week 1. Jimmy Graham's near invincibility inside the 20 combined with Drew Brees' reliance on the screen game with Pierre Thomas and Darren Sproles are mostly to blame. Overall, Colston has attracted just two red-zone targets in six games. Coming off his lowest point total of the season, expect the wideout to again deliver putrid numbers. The Pats, one of the league's most generous secondaries a year ago, have greatly improved in pass D thanks in large part to Aquib Talib. Ranked No. 3 in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus, he's surrendered a 39.3% catch rate and 30.8 QB rating on the season. Likely to occasionally shadow the Saints slot man, Talib will force Brees to look elsewhere."

S"Oh that tricky Vick. As anticipated by 99.9 percent of the fantasy community, the Waterford crystal cracked two weeks ago, pulling up lame in his first meeting with the Giants. Though not at 100-percent, he is expected to return to the lineup in the rematch. When under center, Vick has performed at a QB1 level. His 24.1 per game average in standard settings ranks No. 7 among signal callers. Because of his tender hammy he'll be more of a pocket passer this week, but given his bazooka arm and New York's issues in downfield coverage, Vick is in position of reestablishing himself as a top-10 option. Depleted by injuries and ineptitude, the Giants secondary has surrendered the sixth-most fantasy points to QBs on the year, allowing 262.5 passing yards and 2.0 passing touchdowns per game. According to Pro Football Focus Corey Webster is the only Giant that ranks inside the top-35 in pass coverage. DeSean Jackson, who went nuts in the first meeting (7-132-1), will again rise to the occasion. Re-injury is an unfortunate downside, but based on the delectable matchup and heavy bye week, Vick should actually complete passes against the Giants, unlike Josh Freeman."

S'In a somewhat surprising twist it appears DeMarco Murray is already falling out of favor. According to an Ian Rapoport report, the \'Boys don\'t envision the oft-injured rusher as their long-term solution at RB. With Murray again expected to be sidelined, Randle will get an additional opportunity to showcase his wares. Another strong effort, and he could force a timeshare moving forward. The Oklahoma State product didn\'t stand out in his starting debut. His workload was rigorous (23 touches) and he totaled useful yardage (93), but his 3.4 yards per carry average left a lot to be desired. Still, he gained 56.9 percent of his yards after contact and graded out on the plus side in blitz pickup according to PFF. Jerry Jones deemed his overall effort "exceptional," paving the way for another hefty workload. Lance Dunbar and Phillip Tanner are both expected to be in the mix this week, possibly forcing Randle into the 15-20 touch range. However, given the accommodating matchup, he\'s worth the dice roll in 12-team leagues. The M.O. for most rushing offenses against Detroit: run away from Ndamukong Suh. Do so, and you can find tremendous success. On the year, Detroit has surrendered 4.6 yards per carry and eight total touchdowns to RBs. Expect Randle to record a modest yardage total, but chances are fairly strong the rook crosses the chalk for the second time in his career.  (UPDATE: DeMarco Murray practiced again on Thursday and is on track to return Sunday. In terms of Randle\'s \'Flame\' status, this is a game-changer. At this point, the rookie is nothing more than a desperation FLEX option in deeper formats. It would be a surprise if he logged more than 10-12 touches.)'

S'Last Sunday was quite possibly the bloodiest single day in NFL history, the (Insert any \'Rambo\' movie) week of fantasy football. Highly thought of commodities at several key positions were felled by significant setbacks. Damn you pesky injury imp. Damn you. However, in a next-man-up league, reinforcements are always one dinged wing away from acquiring value. James, filling the void for labrum-shredded Doug Martin, is one such crutch the Bucs, and deep leaguers, are leaning on. The sixth-round pick from \'The U\' isn\'t the flashiest back. Compared to BenJarvus Green-Ellis by scouts, he\'s a gritty runner between the tackles who exhibits only average wiggle and wheels. However, unlike the LawFirm, he\'s a superb receiver out of the backfield, a reliable check-down option for fellow rookie Mike Glennon. On Monday, Greg Schiano propped up James describing him as "a really good one-cut back" with "quick feet" who "seems to fall forward." Yes, he\'s no Muscle Hamster and the Tampa offensive line has sorely underachieved, but there\'s little doubt James will shoulder at least 18-20 touches Thursday against Carolina. The Panthers are a difficult matchup. They\'ve surrendered just 3.88 yards per carry to RBs on the season. But given his anticipated workload, he could very easily match what Zac Stacy did against Carolina last week (21 touches, 87 total yards, TD). In a crippling bye week, sip on a little rum.'

S"Being Calvin Johnson's wingman certainly has its benefits \xe2\x80\x93 P-Diddy parties, attractive ladies and, most importantly for fantasy purposes, gobs of targets. Taking over for Nate Burleson, Durham hasn't lit up fantasy scoreboards the past three weeks, but he's been gifted plenty of opportunities. His 29 targets during that stretch ranks No. 5 among all wide receivers. Likely to attract another eight-plus looks, he should be viewed as a viable WR3 in 12-team formats. Dallas, bombarded often by the competition, has conceded 8.2 yards per attempt and 311.8 yards per game to opposing passers. As a result, six WRs have registered at least five receptions and 80 yards against it, including Riley Cooper last week. With Brandon Carr, the 'Boys' best coverman, expected to shadow Megatron, Durham should roar against Orlando Scandrick and/or Morris Claiborne. Combined the un-dynamic duo have surrendered a catch rate of 62.1 percent. The end-zone may be elusive, but Durham has reasonable odds of recording his third-straight game of five or more receptions."

S"For one of the league's most dynamic slot receivers, it's been a long time coming. A nasty hip injury, which cost him the entire preseason and regular season up to this point, has kept him under wraps. But returning to a full practice Tuesday, Seattle's underneath gadget is expected to be active in Monday night's rather unexciting 'showdown' in St. Louis. For those that stashed him away weeks ago, your diligence is about to pay off. As a whole, the Rams are incredibly giving on defense, particularly against the pass. Trumaine Johnson and Janoris Jenkins have allowed a combined 90-plus QB rating and 62.9 catch rate to their assignments. Many owners typically have trust issues with players coming off an extended hiatus, but you know Pete Carroll and Russell Wilson are itching to see what their prized offseason acquisition can do. Gut feeling, the ninth-ranked WR in per game average a season ago ventures near WR1 territory in his 'Hawks debut, especially in PPR leagues. If he doesn't suffer a setback in practice this week, drop a quarter in the slot machine."

S"It's official. Reed now wears big boy pants. Talked up by the Shanahans over the past several weeks, the rookie dropped the mic last week in Chicago, exploding for a position-best nine receptions (on nine targets), 134 yards and a touchdown. Without a bevy of reliable weapons around him outside Pierre Garcon, the tight end should continue to play a significant role in an improving Redskins pass offense. RGIII, who was mechanically flawed just a couple weeks ago, has started to resemble the dual-threat menace from last year, averaging 272 passing yards and 80.5 rushing yards per game over his past two. With defenses again having to account for the read-option, Reed stands to benefit, particularly this week. Denver is a Jekyll and Hyde team. The offense is the warmhearted doctor who everyone adores. However, the defense represents its sinister side, giving up one explosive pass play after another. No secondary in the league has allowed more vertical plays of 15-plus yards than Denver. In what should be a high-volume game, Reed could easily sit atop the TE rankings when the dust settles Monday. Keep in mind, TEs are performing 17.8 percent above the league average against the Broncos since Week 2."

S"Based on his mugshot, Stills has the look of a Mad Max vagabond. Start him this week, and he could take your bye-ravaged club Beyond Thunderdome. With Jimmy Graham's availability very much in the air, the rookie could see an uptick in targets against a vulnerable Bills secondary. In seven contests this season, a whopping 10 wide receivers have scored 10-plus fantasy points against Buffalo. The primary reason for the inept execution: Justin Rogers. Sucking dust often this year, the corner has yielded 19.3 yards per catch and a QB rating of 142.3 to his assignments. Stills has rarely logged marquee numbers often this year, but he has seen at least 40 snaps in four of his past five games. Considering Marques Colston's struggles, Lance Moore's nagging injuries and Graham's possible absence, he's in line to establish a new career-best in single game targets. This week, there may not be a waiver wideout with more top-20 potential than Stills."

S"A tale of two halves has become habit for Newton. Last year, he stumbled out of the gates over the first several weeks of the season, tarnishing his QB1 image. However by midseason, the light in the attic turned on as he finished tied with Russell Wilson atop the QB per game ranks over the final 10 games of the regular season. This year, it appears he's replicating the uneven ride. Over the first five weeks of 2013, the passer's Scam side reappeared, tallying the 14th-best per game average among signal callers. However, his 33.1 fantasy point bonanza in Minnesota Week 6 has owners wondering if he's about to embark on another multi-game tear. In short: Josh Freeman has better odds of completing consecutive passes. On short rest and facing an above average Buccaneers secondary, the Panther is a fringe QB1 even in a bye-heavy week. In his past two meeting against Tampa, he's failed to surpass the 20-point mark in standard formats. Torched by Nick Foles and Matt Ryan in back-to-back games, the Bucs have underperformed of late. Still, Darrelle Revis, the second-best cover corner in the league per Pro Football Focus' metrics, has marooned many a receiver, surrendering a lowly 7.7 yards per catch and 61.1 QB rating. In what should be a cornea-burning affair, Cam posts only modest numbers. Give me Russell Wilson (at StL), Eli Manning (at Phi) and Ben Roethlisberger (at Oak) instead."

S"Doctored Jon Lester junk. That's exactly what the Broncos will throw at Washington's power hitter this weekend. In classic Lucifer Shanahan style, an unexpected RBBC has slowly formed in D.C. Though Morris continues to be the primary ball carrier (91-to-31 attempts), the season snap distribution between the incumbent and Roy Helu is nearly even (226-to-213). This week, don't be surprised if the script flips. Given the shortcomings of the Washington defense and the fact the 'Skins have played from behind often this year, it's entirely likely a lopsided affair breaks out early, relegating Morris to watch the action from the sidelines. Clearly, Helu has emerged as the main passing-down option and, if last week's TD hat-trick is any indication, a legitimate goal-line gremlin. If the expected game flow unfolds, the 'backup' will dominate touches in the second half. Toss in Denver's stinginess against the run (2.8 yards per carry allowed to RBs) and with Von Miller back in action, and Morris is a difficult RB to trust. Keep in mind no rusher has eclipsed the 75-yard mark on the ground against the Broncos this year. Pierre Thomas (vs. Buf), Le'Veon Bell (at Oak) and Mike James (vs. Car) are viable alternatives."

S"Joe Philbin must be a Bud man. Miller time has rarely happened this season. Perpetual thorn, Daniel Thomas, continues to receive more touches than he deserves, limiting the starter's big play potential. Despite averaging a healthy 4.3 yards per carry (Thomas 3.4), Miller has seen 40 or more snaps and totaled 15-plus touches once each this season. Can you say criminally underused? Against New England, don't expect the blueprint the suddenly change. Down Vincent Wilfork and Jerod Mayo, the Pats weren't overly generous in the trenches last week. Against a formidable Jets offensive line, they held Chris Ivory to a lousy 3.1 yards per carry, though he did top the century mark on an exhaustive 34 carries. In that contest, Dont'a Hightower and Chris Jones both graded out on the plus side defending the run according to Pro Football Focus. As a heavily invested Miller owner, I hope I'm way off on this, but because of Philbin's stubbornness and the Patriots' still rigid defense, the 'Fin is again highly untrustworthy. Please, Joe, get a clue."

S"FLASH! AHHHHHHH! HE WON'T SAVE ANYONE OF US! Last week, Brandon Weeden couldn't hit a well-fed Packers fan in the gut from five-yards out, a miserable effort that led to his benching. However, going from Weeden to Jason Campbell is akin to trading in a woefully (expletive) dumb phone for just a (expletive) dumb phone. They both excel at misconnections. Oakland was the last team desperate enough to rely on Campbell. In six 2011 starts, the QB averaged 7.1 yards per attempt and 195.0 yards per game while posting a 6:4 TD:INT split. By no means is that Blaine Gabbert-terrible, but it's certainly not encouraging. Understand, Campbell is a check-down maestro, a tendency that may ultimately kill Gordon's big-play ability. KC's defensive play will also have a similar effect. Corners Sean Smith, Marcus Cooper and, when healthy, Brandon Flowers have consistently executed at a high level. Smith and Cooper, targeted a combined 68 times, have surrendered just 28 receptions (41.1 catch percentage). Overall, only five wide receivers have totaled nine fantasy points or more against the Chiefs. After what will surely be an abysmal offensive performance by Campbell, maybe Michael Lombardi will seriously entertain signing Jeff Garcia."

S"In a high-flying offense and gifted some of the best hands in the biz, it's stunning Witten doesn't offer more consistency from a fantasy perspective. As always, he offers more value in PPR settings, but in standard formats he's totaled double-digit fantasy points only twice this season. Most discouraging, he's attracted six targets or less in three of his past five contests. The Lions are far from suffocating defensively. Since Week 3, they've conceded 316.2 passing yards per game and eight total passing touchdowns. However, as witnessed last week against Cincinnati, most of those connections have come on explosive plays to wide receivers downfield. Martellus Bennett is the only tight end to compile 65 yards or more against them. Equally impressive, they've allowed just one TD to a TE this year. Witten is a hard commodity to demote, but if you scored Jordan Reed off waivers and play in a one-TE league, he's bench worthy."

S"As predicted by many fanalysts preseason, everyone's favorite Mustachioed Tomato, Andy Reid, has done wonders with the Kansas City offense. Smith may not be a statistical megastar but through two weeks the game-manager has engineered the Chiefs offense very efficiently. His 5.7 yards per attempt is nothing to write home about, but his very respectable 94.7 QB rating and pair of multi-TD performances are. Averaging 35 attempts per game in consecutive wins versus Jacksonville and Dallas, he's sure to ramp up the throws in the un-brotherly Reid boo fest Thursday at Philly. Unquestionably, Jamaal Charles will be featured early and often to slow down tempo, but Smith's arm will also be worked plenty. The Eagles' pedal-to-the-metal offense has executed brilliantly thus far averaging 477 total yards per game. KC's defense, meanwhile, might be the league's most underrated, however, it's highly probable Michael Vick and friends hang a hefty number. That happens and Smith will sling it some 40-plus times. Toss in his ability to scramble \xe2\x80\x93 he's actually dashed for five more yards than Vick (82 to 77) \xe2\x80\x93 and he's worth weighing as a back-end QB1 in 12-team and deeper leagues. Keep in mind the Eagles currently check in at No. 27 in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus. Given how poorly corner Cary Williams has played of late (64.7 catch rate allowed), Smith and Dwayne Bowe are bound to hook up for a TD once or thrice."

S"For Reggie Bush owners, getting 'Joiqued' is a rather unpleasant feeling. The backup rusher, who's already snaked two goal-line plunges from the incumbent, will be a perpetual thorn in the side, particularly this week. Even if Bush, hobbled by a knee injury, is available in the nation's capital, Bell should take on an expanded role. Over the first two weeks he's accounted for 24 total touches, 164 total yards (6.8 yards per touch) and two touchdowns, seeing roughly 30-35 snaps per game. Given Bush's physical limitations and the ultra-friendly matchup, Bell should be viewed as more than just FLEX-only material. On the young year, Washington has surrendered 5.7 yards per carry to opposing backs. LeSean McCoy ran roughshod over them Week 1 for 184 yards. Sadder for 'Skins fans, James Starks, who makes an antennae-less slug look fast, plodded his way to 168 total yards (6.6 ypc) last week in Lambeau, the first 100-yard Green Bay rusher since Brandon Jackson accomplished the feat Week 5 of 2010. Highly versatile, tough between the tackles and cemented as the primary goal-line back, Bell storms The Mall en route to high-end RB2 numbers. Ring him."

S"Already embroiled in a self-made QB controversy, the league's most dysfunctional franchise once again is giving local stand-up comedians and newspaper headline writers plenty of fresh material. Though much of what's recently transpired with the Jets is chuckle-worthy, the backfield really isn't. Chris Ivory is still a large part of Rex Ryan's RB tandem, but Powell is slowly distancing himself from the ex-Saint. Powell has out-snapped (95-to-49), outplayed and outproduced his less-versatile teammate thus far. Expect more of this same inside the Meadowlands this week against Buffalo. The Bills D, up to their bumbling ways as usual, has surrendered favorable ground yards to the opposition. Against New England and Carolina they allowed 4.7 yards per carry to rushers, though they've yet to give up a touchdown. Shuffling behind a rock solid offensive line that currently ranks top-10 in run-blocking, Powell is an upside flex option in 12-team and deeper formats. And, for the record, this might be the only time this year a Jet will make an appearance in this space."

S"Note to self, if Hopkins ever challenges me to an arm-wrestling match while operating at full-strength, fake an injury. For a wide receiver, the rookie is brutishly strong. He's also the most well-rounded target from this year's NFL draft class. The Clemson product's scorching start has burned down the house, especially in PPR leagues. The beneficiary of many one-on-one situations, he's attracted 20 targets (top-20 among WRs) catching 12 passes for 183 yards and a touchdown. Absolutely brilliant in the Texans OT victory over Tennessee last week, he should carry momentum over into Baltimore. The struggling Ravens, who continue to have issues on the back-end defensively, are in a very vulnerable state. Corey Graham, expected to be Hopkins' primary shadow, has surrendered a 128.6 QB rating and 71.4 catch rate according to Pro Football Focus. Due to the inflexibility of Baltimore's front and with Andre Johnson coming off a concussion, the youngster has all the makings for another sensational day. Get him off the pine and into the game."

S"After serving a two-game suspension, last season's splashy rookie is finally back in action. Unfortunately, with Brandon Weeden sidelined by a bum thumb, traveling vacuum salesman Brian Hoyer will be his quarterback. Yep, you guessed it, Hoyer sucks. In a pair of appearances with the Cardinals last season, he completed a mere 56.6 percent of his passes, averaging just 6.2 yards per attempt. However, in a contest against a highly exploitable secondary, Norv Turner should draw up several high-percentage throws for the journeyman, employing various screens and shallow crosses for Gordon. If the wideout can shake off the rust quickly, he's likely to deliver sound WR3 numbers. Minnesota corners Josh Robinson and Chris Cook have conceded a combined 20 receptions on 23 targets thus far (86.9 catch-percentage). Gordon was a top-30 WR from Week 5 on last season. Despite the revolving door at QB, expect him to pick up where he left off."

An animated skyscraper at 6-foot-6, 251-pounds, the ex-Golden Domer is quickly becoming one of the league's premier vertical threats. His blend of size, speed, athleticism and route savvy will soon push him into the TE1 class, possibly as early as this week. Green Bay, down its best corner in Casey Hayward, has struggled in coverage over the first two weeks. Opposing passers have averaged a stratospheric 9.2 yards per attempt against them. Tight ends, too, have reaped major success versus the Pack, evident in what Vernon Davis and virtual unknown Jordan Reed achieved Weeks 1 and 2 respectively. Jermaine Gresham will continue to get 6-8 targets per game, but with Green Bay likely focused on containing A.J. Green, Eifert has strong odds of converting a long touchdown. Bank on a Week 3 break out."

S"Call the CDC. Reported cases of the 'dropsies' are on the rise in New England. For the first time in recorded history, even Brady's staunchest haters feel bad for him. Down Danny Amendola and Rob Gronkowski, the once unstoppable Pats offense has slammed into a brick wall. As seen in last week's deplorable effort versus the Jets, rookies Kenbrell Thompkins and Aaron Dobson are angering No. 12, for good reason. The dastardly duo have run circuitous routes and combined for four dropped passes. If not for Julian Edelman, Brady would be in the lower-echelon of QB2s. Unfortunately, he could venture into that territory this week against the Buccaneers. Likely without Gronk and with Darrelle Revis expected to shadow Edelman most of the game, another sub 15-point fantasy performance is in the offing. Against Geno Smith and Drew Brees, the Bucs surrendered a lowly 6.8 yards per attempt while also forcing three interceptions. Better days are ahead for Tom Terrific, but until Gronk and Amendola return, lukewarm numbers should be anticipated."

Next to Sharknados, circus performers caked with face make-up are the most frightening entities on Earth. It's been tough sledding for the Oompha Loompah thus far. Through two games, one against what was deemed a favorable matchup at Oakland, he's tallied a wretched 2.88 yards per carry. Now dealing with a tender ankle, a setback that isn't expected to sideline him this week in Seattle, he's only sliding deeper and deeper into the pit of fantasy hell. Against a 'Hawks front that absolutely dominated the line of scrimmage last week against the Niners, limiting Frank Gore to only 16 yards on nine carries, he will again find little breathing room. The Jags offensive line, which was expected to improve after adding top pick Luke Joeckel in the draft, continues to execute poorly. According to Pro Football Focus, the Jags line ranks inside the bottom ten in run-blocking. Unless you're a masochist, bench MJD. Keep in mind, Jacksonville is a 20-point dog according to Vegas."

S"It's a miracle A) DMC ranks top-10 among fantasy RBs and B) His lower extremities are still intact. I have to give credit where credit is due, the lampooned rusher is getting the last laugh, for now. Thought to be a major weakness, the Raiders offensive line, down Jared Veldheer and Menelik Watson, has performed admirably, ranking No. 13 in run-blocking according to Pro Football Focus. As a result, McFadden has burst through wide lanes, run hard downhill and racked ample yards after contact. He's notched 4.9 yards per carry and ranks fifth in YACO among RBs. The Broncos, however, are an extremely difficult matchup. Surprisingly, they've stonewalled opposing rushing attacks without Von Miller. Hole plunger Kevin Vickerson has done a marvelous job sniffing out the run, ranking top-10 in stops per PFF. Overall, RBs have averaged a despicable 2.0 yards per carry against Denver. Yes, DMC will contribute appreciable production in the pass game, but in what should be a terribly lopsided affair, expect only a tepid outcome."

S"After a week filled with Krispy Kremes, the Packers' seesaw used and abused Washington, arguably the league's worst secondary, in Week 3. Targeted a career-high 12 times, he grabbed 11 receptions for 178 yards. No doubt, it was a standout performance, but given Jones' inconsistent nature and the unappealing matchup, don't expect a splashy encore. Unless your name is Jordy Nelson, the pendulum constantly swings in Green Bay's socialist offense. The Bengals secondary very quietly is one of the league's best. Terrance Newman, Pacman Jones and especially Leon Hall, have held their own to start the year. The latter corner ranks No. 13 in pass coverage according to PFF, allowing a 50.0 catch rate. Jones was a fixture inside the red-zone a season ago, leading the team in targets with 19, but taking a backseat to Randall Cobb, Jordy and Jermichael Finley in that area of the field thus far \xe2\x80\x93 he has two RZ tgts through games \xe2\x80\x93 another 10-plus TD season seems farfetched, assuming the trend continues. For the reasons mentioned above, don't bank on another top-20 week."

S"Unleashing his inner diva Monday night against Cincinnati, Brown vocalized his frustrations with Ben Roethlisberger in a heated exchange on the sidelines. And he didn't stop there. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the 'seething' wideout also tongue-lashed offensive coordinator Todd Haley, complaining he wasn't seeing enough targets. When Jerricho Cotchery receives the same number of looks, he has a point. Brown's outward plea may award him 10-plus targets this week, but expect pedestrian numbers against one of league's nastiest defenses. Though torched by A.J. Green Week 1, the Bears currently rank No. 6 in pass coverage. Corners Tim Jennings and Peanut Tillman have yielded an impressive 76.1 QB rating through two games. Add that to the Steelers' offensive line woes and it should be a long night for a franchise on the brink of dropping to 0-3. Unless Pittsburgh rectifies its issues soon (e.g. Throw Haley in the Monongahela), Brown will continue to be a largely undependable WR, even in 12-team three-WR leagues."

S"Owners who plucked Pryor off waivers last week banking on him being cleared in time for what surely would've been a buffet of fantasy goodness against Washington experienced a pendulum of emotion. Not available. Available. Cleared. Practiced. Only limited practice. Will start. Inactive. For those in challenging leagues, the sways were hard to stomach. But one bland Matt Flynn performance and several doctor assurances later, it appears the intriguing multidimensional weapon will be in uniform for the Sunday night-capper against San Diego, a very enticing matchup. The Chargers, and not surprisingly Washington, have been the league's most generous pass defense. The secondary has allowed 8.4 yards per attempt, 329.3 passing yards per game and 2.0 passing touchdowns per game this season. Its finest performance this year, holding Tony Romo to a 'pedestrian' 244-2-0-15 line in Week 3. Pryor, who's tweaked mechanics, improved accuracy and remarkable play extension have opened eyes in Fantasyland, is a borderline QB1 in a bye-heavy week. Burn the midnight oil."

S"One month ago Wilson was expected to be the greatest thing in fantasy since real-time scoring automation (Sidebar: The old pen/paper, 14.4 dial-up days was the definition of tedious). His electric open-field speed, ankle-breaking wiggle and hefty workload sans Andre Brown were supposed to rocket his value into the stratosphere. Then he stepped on a grenade. Two costly fumbles and numerous blown blitz pick-ups later the No. 57 ranked RB has become arguably the most untrustworthy rusher in virtual pigskin, until now. This is the week Wilson finally delivers. The stats may not convey, but he's slowly improved over the past couple weeks. Running too timidly at times after his Week 1 catastrophe, he's regained confidence lost in himself and from Tom Coughlin. Wilson and Da'Rel Scott, who was surprisingly released Tuesday, split snaps since Week 2, but the incumbent shouldered 73% of the Giants' carries during that stretch. The underachieving Giants offensive line has struggled mightily in the run-blocking department, but if there was ever a week to spark a turnaround this is it. Philly's defensive front is leaky. On the season, they've surrendered 4.3 yards per carry, 151.8 total yards per game and three TDs to RBs. ILB Mychal Kendricks has especially floundered, ranking No. 50 among linebackers against the run per Pro Football Focus. At 0-4 and clearly in desperation mode, the Giants need to get the ground game going. Look for the brotherly Eagles to welcome Wilson with open arms."

S"Back in the fold after missing Week 3 due to a concussion and earning a little extra R&R from the bye, Lacy is again at full-strength and poised to grab the spotlight. James Starks and Jonathan Franklin were outstanding in relief, but clearly Mike McCarthy wants the former 'Bama standout to be his bellcow. Starting this week, he should get the call roughly 16-19 times per game with Franklin/Starks peppered in occasionally on pass downs. Assuming he nets that kind of workload, the rolling cheddar wheel will flatten the competition. Though extremely talented up front, the Lions have again found it difficult containing the run. Attack lanes away from Ndamukong Suh, and success is sure to follow. Detroit has yielded 5.0 yards per carry, 127.0 total yards per game and seven touchdowns to RBs, equal to the third-most fantasy points allowed. Count on offensive coordinator Tom Clements to script several off-tackle runs to the left side, picking on Nick Fairley and Willie Young. Ride the leader of the Pack."

S"The Jaguars are arguably the worst NFL team of this generation. When it's all said and done, they could conceivably give the '76 Dreamsicles a run for their money. Sam Bradford has been more Mr. Hyde than Dr. Jekyll in Brian Schottenheimer's spread offense, failing once again to live up to his once glowing No. 1 pick billing. He's again completed under 60% of his attempts and has netted a ghastly 6.0 yards per attempt. Still, it's the Jags, a defense that's allowed 37 pass plays of 10-plus yards. Expected to be without the services of CB2 Dwayne Gratz, they're even more vulnerable. Tavon Austin and Austin Pettis have yielded more fantasy value among Rams wideouts this year, but Givens, who has a 100-yard game under his belt and is averaging a splendid 18.1 yards per catch, is sure to please in Week 5. Ram it!"

S"The Puddle Jumpers, who inspired many witty newspaper headlines preseason, surprisingly haven't sputtered out of control. A resurrected defense combined with a strong ground game have them at .500. Geno Smith hasn't lit the world on fire and continues to serve up turnovers, but he's exceeded many, including my, expectations, on pace for 4,700 combined yards. With the rookie sans Santonio Holmes and possibly Stephen Hill, the door of opportunity swings open for Kerley in a favorable matchup down South. Atlanta corners Desmond Trufant and Robert McClain have executed poorly so far this season giving up a QB rating of 115.0 and 69.8 catch%age to their assignments. Overall, the Falcons have surrendered the fourth-most fantasy points to WRs. Kerley is far from a true No. 1, but the spirited target's shiftiness and strong route-running ability should prove useful in a pinch."

S"Miles Austin is hamstrung once again. In other news, the American government is still overwhelmingly incompetent. Some things never change. With the wide receiver inactive last week, Williams, a well-rounded rookie from Baylor, filled the void effectively in San Diego. On eight targets, he hauled in seven receptions for 71 yards, a top-36 WR line for the week. Given the nagging nature of hamstring pulls and Austin\xe2\x80\x99s long history of them, it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely he\xe2\x80\x99ll again be in street clothes this week, though Jason Garrett is more optimistic about his chances this week compared to last. With Dallas welcoming Peyton Manning to town, Williams should again finish with useful WR3 numbers. Garbage-time, sometimes starting in the second quarter, is quickly becoming a weekly occurrence for Denver opponents. Against a secondary that's surrendered the most 20-yard pass plays this season, he could clean up in meaningless action. With Dez Bryant attracting so much attention, he certainly stands to benefit from single coverage."

S"Seemingly ubiquitous, the QB's face, bulging biceps and artistic ink are everywhere. Whether pitching Mighty Wings, video games or Yahoo fantasy, it's impossible to escape his presence. For those who invested an early-round pick in his services, the spots also serve as unwelcome reminder. Kaepernick, expected to take a step forward in his first full season as the starter, has largely disappointed. After his thrashing of Green Bay in Week 1, he's compiled a meager 187.3 combined yards per game and posted a 2:4 TD:INT split. Worst of all, he completed just 52.5% of his attempts during that stretch. His subsequent 14.0 points per game since Week 2 ranks No. 29 among passers. Puke. Without a reliable third option and with Vernon Davis limited by a hamstring injury, defenses have bracketed Anquan Boldin and keyed on the read-option. Until Kyle Williams or, when back in the mix Mario Manningham/Michael Crabtree, step up, disappointing efforts for Kap are sure to continue, particularly this week. The Texans have yet to surrender a 200-yard passer and are giving up just 6.0 yards per attempt. With Ed Reed healthy and Jonathan Joseph playing at a high level (63.5 QB rating, 44.4 catch rate allowed), Houston has grounded its opponents. Considering the situation, Kaepernick owners should weigh alternatives."

S'Mess with Sasquatch (BREAKING: He\'s real!). That\'s what I would rather do than count a standout effort from Mr. Mediocre this week against Seattle. It hasn\'t been all champagne and roses for the rusher since coming over from Cleveland two weeks ago. Granted he\'s still adjusting to a new scheme, but his ghastly 2.8 yards per carry and minimal usage in the pass game have been masked by a pair of touchdowns. Chuck Pagano told the Indy Star Thursday he\'s "not concerned" about the RB\'s lack of production noting was "a shoelace here or there" away from busting a long run last week. Even if Ahmad Bradshaw (neck) isn\'t available Sunday \xe2\x80\x93 he didn\'t practice Wednesday and could be headed for surgery \xe2\x80\x93 T-Pain isn\'t a slam-dunk RB1. The \'Hawks were gashed by Arian Foster and the Texans last week, but remain one of the more rigid units against the run. On the season, they\'ve surrendered a mere 3.4 yards per carry to RBs. Nose tackle Brandon Menbane, second only to Damon Harrison in defending the run, should stonewall Richardson early and often. Keep in mind the Indy O-line grades below average according to Pro Football Focus. Gio Bernard (vs. NE), Bilal Powell (at Atl) and Joique Bell (at GB) are stronger options.'

S"Fired from a cannon last week against Miami, the fleet-footed Minion had a game to remember. Attacking the 'Fins by air and land, he totaled 142 yards and two touchdowns, an output that set the pace among RBs in Week 4. Sproles' low center of gravity, ankle-breaking shiftiness and open-field jets make him a matchup nightmare for most defenses, especially those lacking speed at linebacker. The Bears had difficulties keeping Reggie Bush under wraps on the fast-track in Detroit last week, but back at home, they should tighten the screws against Sproles. RBs are averaging just 28.5 receiving yards per game against them. Linebacker James Anderson ranks No. 1 at his position in pass coverage per Pro Football Focus. Battery-mate D.J. Williams has also scored positive marks. Overall, the Bears have not allowed a RB to exceed 50 receiving yards in 16 straight games. If there's a Saints RB poised for a big day, it's Pierre Thomas. The Chicago native has averaged 142.4 total yards per game in three career clashes with the Bears. Expect Sproles to take a backseat."

S"After only making a cameo in the first-half of last week's contest at Buffalo, Smith put on a show post-intermission as Joe Flacco and company frantically tried to dig themselves out of a hole. Overall, he finished with five receptions for a career-high 166 yards and a touchdown, an effort that pushed him inside the WR top-10 in per game average on the season. Smith has developed into a well-rounded receiver this year. Not deployed exclusively on 'go' routes, he's run more slants and sideline outs, becoming Flacco's main man. Still, he remains an elite downfield weapon. His 18 targets of 20-plus yards ranks No. 1 among all WRs. Miami's secondary isn't nearly as bad as it portrayed on Bourbon Street. Drew Brees typically humiliates defenses at home. On the season, Dolphins corners Brent Grimes and Nolan Carroll have yielded a combined 53.2 catch rate and 65.9 QB rating to their assignments. With that in mind and considering Smith has NEVER notched consecutive 100-yard games in his career, a lackluster performance is in the offing."

S"Bowe's sluggish start has been a hot-button topic in Fantasyland. Some believe his inconsistency is only temporary. Others, however, believe it will continue to be the norm. Put me in the latter class. Alex Smith is the Bronson Arroyo of quarterbacks, a steady, durable soft-tosser who manages a game effectively. And therein lies the problem. Jamaal Charles is the centerpiece of Andy Reid's offense, operating as a runner/receiver. The rusher has averaged 23.3 touches per game. Because of Smith's downfield hindrances \xe2\x80\x93 he's attempted only five passes beyond 20 yards this season, the same number Matt Flynn chucked last week against Washington \xe2\x80\x93 Bowe has yet to surpass 60 receiving yards in a game. That streak will continue against one of the stiffest secondaries in the league. DeAndre Hopkins is the only wideout to exceed the 10-point threshold versus Tennessee in standard formats. Alterraun Verner and Jason McCourty have executed remarkably well, ranking No. 1 and No. 8 respectively among corners in pass coverage according to PFF. Off an encouraging Week 4, look for Rain-Bowe Brite to make an appearance in the follow-up."

S'Growing up in downstate Illinois, my ever-wise Bears-loving father always stressed, "Son, always pay your bills on time and never, ever date a Packer." Yes, Pops, the credit card payment was delivered punctually this week, but against your better judgement, I\'m straying away from the latter piece of advice. Sorry, but the matchup is unquestionably favorable and Tolzien\'s Carson Palmer-like looks (Really it\'s uncanny) are simply too irresistible to ignore. The Wisconsinite has hardly badgered opponents since taking over for Aaron Rodgers. In two starts, he\'s exceeded 280 passing yards in each contest, but posted an appalling 1:5 TD:INT split. Though his decision making has been far from stellar, he\'s completed nearly 66% of his passes, averaged 8.48 yards per attempt and displayed better-than-advertised arm strength. Minnesota, already in shambles defensively, lost another starter in its secondary, Josh Robinson, last week. Essentially a skeleton crew on D, the Vikes are inching their way closer to the No. 1 overall pick in next May\'s NFL draft. Over the past five weeks, the Purple Pansies have surrendered 269 passing yards per game and a 12:1 TD:INT split to signal callers, equal to the second-most fantasy points allowed. Rodgers rolled up 316 combined yards and two scores in the Packers\' first tango with Minnesota back in Week 8. Sure, if A-Rod is the new X-Box One, Tolzien is an Atari 2600 with a sticky joystick, but it\'s no stretch to think he can\'t match the All-Pro\'s previous numbers versus the Vikes. Take a chance.'

S"Sullen, sulking expressions like the one visible on MJD's face (see left) have been commonplace for the rusher this season. You can't blame him. Trapped in an endless nightmare, he and his Jaguar teammates have become the butt of several jokes around Fantasyland. Though his superficial numbers have left a great deal to be desired (2.87 ypc, 61.0 typg, 4 TDs, No. 30 RB rank), the Oompa-Loompa has played admirably this year. When given time and space to operate, he's bowled through would-be tacklers on a regular basis. Impressively, he's gained 68.5 percent of his yards after initial contact. He's reached the 100 total yard mark only once this season, but he's been at least FLEX-useful of late, finding the end-zone in three of his past five games. Matched against a Houston team 'led' by a coach who's clearly lost his marbles (Matt Schaub couldn't ignite an offense with a flamethrower and a bucket of napalm, Gary), he could deliver his finest performance of the year. Uncharacteristically forgiving in the trenches, the Texans have allowed 4.69 yards per carry to RBs since Week 7. Last week, Rashad Jennings ground Toro into burger, dropping 150 rush yards on his beloved club. Buy your boo-boo a Jag."

S'Ingram, similar to another ex-Alabama back who claims he\'s still a "good" player, is quite possibly the most ordinary rusher in the league. In his first two seasons with the Saints, he averaged a mere 3.9 yards per carry, often playing second fiddle to better-rounded options Pierre Thomas and Darren Sproles. His merely adequate combination of power, speed and vision only dazzle when an extremely favorable matchup is on the docket. Two weeks ago that opponent was Dallas, a victim the rusher racked a career-high 160 total yards and a touchdown against. This week, it\'s Atlanta, an equally exploitable matchup. Dissected routinely in all facets of the game, the Falcons have been especially generous in the trenches. Over their past five games the Dirty Birds have given up 4.89 yards per carry, 153.8 rushing yards per game and five rushing TDs to RBs. Ingram crashed back down to earth last week, netting just 22 snaps and seven touches for 29 yards, but, in what should be a lopsided affair, expect a workload uptick. FLEX the man in deeper formats.'

S"Widely considered a hero in the pizza community after sacrificing a limb to rescue a pepperoni in distress, Burleson is on the verge of seeing his first action since Week 3. Barring a setback in practice this week, expect the Lions' No. 2 to sink his teeth into the competition. A primary weapon of Matthew Stafford pre-injury, Burleson averaged 7.7 targets and 6.3 receptions per game over the first three weeks of the season. If he goes, count on a near identical output. Tampa has struggled immensely against slot machines this year. Owners who pulled the lever on Harry Douglas (twice), Rishard Matthews and Doug Baldwin against the Bucs hit jackpot. Combined the trio averaged 7.5 receptions and 119.5 yards per game, totaling five touchdowns. Burleson may be a bit rusty, but because the injury didn't impact his lower body, he should be in relatively good football shape. With Darrelle Revis likely to shadow Calvin Johnson, the crafty veteran should have little difficulty dominating Leonard Johnson and Jonathan Banks, a duo that's surrendered a combined 66.3 catch rate. Order extra cheese."

S'If there\'s an album name that best describes Wright, it has to be the Rolling Stones classic "Sticky Fingers." Yes, he\'s rarely found the end-zone this season, but the tacky-handed wideout has logged eight games with at least five receptions. A targets hog with Ryan Fitzpatrick under center, he\'s attracted 21 looks the past two weeks, a number sure to rise this week against Oakland. The strength of the Raiders defense is clearly in the trenches, a characteristic that will surely encourage Mike Munchak to lean heavily on his quarterback\'s arm. Discussed previously in this space, Tracy Porter is the highest ranked Oakland corner in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus. And he checks in at No. 66. Bombarded often through the air, the Raiders have conceded the sixth-most fantasy points to wide receivers. Since Week 8, at least one wideout has totaled 11-fantasy points or more against them. The perfect underneath complement for an average-armed QB, Wright should again satisfy the appetite of PPR owners.'

Running crisper routes and benefiting from soft coverage, he\xe2\x80\x99s attracted 14 targets over the past two weeks, catching 10 passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. Housler is a brutishly strong, athletic weapon many thought would establish an instant chemistry with Palmer, similar to what Brandon Myers accomplished with the QB as a Raider last year. Gaining the confidence of his quarterback and the coaching staff, he could indeed become that player down the homestretch. Outside a Week 16 confrontation with Seattle, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any tough matchups remaining, including this week against Indy's umbrella defense. Carving up the Colts secondary underneath last Thursday, Tennessee's Delanie Walker caught 10 passes for 91 yards and a score. If your TE slot has beleaguered you most of the season, the Cardinal is worth a long look"

S"Disagreements, subtle public jabs and inconsistent play \xe2\x80\x93 Washington is about as functional as a government-run website. Just a couple months ago, optimism was brimming in the nation's capital. Cleared for takeoff by team doctors, RGIII beat the expected timetable and looked poised to lead a Redskins team to its second-consecutive playoff appearance. However, rust accumulated during his long layoff created mechanical flaws in his delivery. It also created an overwhelming sense of timidity. Barely resembling the unstoppable read-option Superman of 2012, the sophomore passer rarely ran, missed targets badly and generally underwhelmed for fantasy purposes. He's cleaned up in garbage time, particularly against meek opponents, but it's unlikely he'll have that luxury this week. Carlos Rogers and company have done an excellent job preventing explosive pass plays this season. They've allowed just 6.43 yards per attempt, 11 passing touchdowns and 235.5 passing yards per game to QBs. With the exception of Jake Locker, they've also held dual-threat QBs in check, evident in the sour lines posted by Russell Wilson (142-1-33), Andrew Luck (164-0-24-1) and Cam Newton (169-0-1-17). If RGIII stumbles out of the gate, as usual (67.6 first quarter QB rating), don't count on him smelling like a rose late."

S"On again. Off again. On again. Off again. That's the story of Johnson. Under the prime-time lights, the rusher's CJ2K's persona made a cameo \xe2\x80\xa6 for a half. On his first eight carries against the Colts, Johnson sprinted through tight spaces, found open-field and left defenders in the dust, totaling 70 yards and a pair of scores. However, after halftime, CJ2Lame reared his ugly head, logging 16 yards on nine carries. His fantasy day still ranked top-10, but the hold/cold nature of his game is maddening to watch. This week, prepare to be overtly frustrated. A laughing stock against the run over the past dozen seasons, the Raiders have finally rectified their issues, for the most part, in the trenches under Dennis Allen. On the year they've surrendered just 3.76 yards per carry to RBs. More impressive, Andre Brown is the only rusher to cross the 90-yard threshold against them. Given the rowdy road environment and Johnson's complete unreliability, he should ride the pine if you have viable alternatives (e.g. Zac Stacy, Rashad Jennings or Pierre Thomas)."

S"Yes I realize he doesn't meet the 50% start requirement, but I feel a moral obligation to tell the fantasy masses to SLOW YOUR ROLL over the Tampa upstart. Admittedly, he looked spectacular last week against a disheveled Atlanta frontline. He displayed eagle-eye vision, marked elusiveness and burst through the hole operating as Tampa's bellcow. On 32 touches, he finished with an absurd 167 total yards and a TD hat-trick. No question, the Browns castoff, who improbably couldn't supplant Willis McGahee, Chris Ogbonnaya or Fozzy Whittaker on the Cleveland depth-chart, will continue to tote the load, but don't expect the Bucs to make it Rainey in Detroit. Since Week 7, the Lions have been downright ferocious defending the run. No team has allowed fewer yards or fantasy points to the RB position. Shutting down Matt Forte, Le'Veon Bell and Gio Bernard during that stretch, the Lions surrendered just 2.24 yards per carry and 80.5 total yards per game to RBs. That's it. Rainey's Week 11 was magical, but, folks, he's no David Blaine."

Targeted 10.6 times per game, the sixth-highest mark among WRs, he's become an irreplaceable figure in standard and PPR leagues, hauling in 7.4 receptions for 95.2 yards per game. He's also cut rug in the end-zone five times. Normally he's must-start material, but this week against Joe Haden and the Browns, he's no sure-fire lock. Haden packs vise grips, a near shutdown corner similar to Tampa's Darrelle Revis. Notable names Calvin Johnson, Dwayne Bowe, A.J. Green and the aforementioned Wallace all underwhelmed against him. Overall, he's yielded a 52.3 catch rate to his assignments, limiting them to a lowly 9.3 yards per catch. Brown has a stellar track-record against Cleveland, but working mostly as the No. 2 previously, he only occasionally lined up against Haden. On the road, don't bank on top-12 or maybe even top-24 numbers."

S"Never, ever rub the Hoodie the wrong way. According to some reports, the terms in which Welker left New England weren't exactly the friendliest. Well-publicized drops led many to believe his play was in decline, including those within the Patriots organization. As a result, he, similar to current teammate Peyton Manning, packed up and headed out West, determined to breathe new life in his alleged fading career. And he did exactly that. Working as No. 18's greaseman underneath, he's reeled in five or more receptions in a game five times and averaged 11.9 points per game in standard settings, good for WR1 status in 12-team leagues. Welker, assuming he passes post-concussion protocol, will be highly motivated to perform and the Patriots secondary is decimated by injuries (Alfonzo Dennard (OUT), Aqib Talib (major question mark)), but you know Bill Belichick will skew schemes in an attempt to contain Welker. Against slot receivers this season, New England has allowed a mediocre 52.5 yards per game. He's indispensable in PPR, but off his third sub-10 point fantasy effort in four games, Welker could struggle in standard settings, again provided he plays."

S"Distancing himself from the game-manager stereotype, Smith has achieved relatively solid numbers in recent weeks without much fanfare. Since Week 7, he's averaged 220.4 passing yards and 25.4 rushing yards per game with five multi-score performances. His final tally suffered a bit last week in Washington largely due to an enormous early lead. As a result, he bled the clock, attempting only 20 passes. However, against an exploitable Oakland that impossibly made Geno Smith appear competent, he should deliver QB1 production when needed most. Over the past five weeks, only New England, Minnesota and Indy have been more generous to opposing signal callers than the Silver and Yack. Including Geno's four-TD improbable 23-point fantasy effort in standard Yahoo leagues, six passers have finished inside the QB top-12 against the Raiders this season. Oakland's highest-rated corner, Tracy Porter (63.0 catch%age allowed), ranks No. 91 in pass coverage per Pro Football Focus. And, again, he's their best. Owners who've survived with sketchy options at quarterback should strongly consider banging the tribal drum."

S"After a stirring midseason run that helped propel this writer into his fantasy playoffs in a PPR league and stave off public humiliation (Placed a side bet involving a Brazilian wax. Thankfully, my undercarriage will remain undisturbed.), the PT Bruiser has slowed to a stop. From Weeks 8-12, the underrated Saint tallied 17.9 fantasy points in a PPR setting, firmly ranking him inside the top-15 among rushers during that stretch. However, recording just 18 total touches over the past couple weeks, he was a victim of in-game circumstances and a pair of tough matchups (at Sea and vs. Car). That won't be the case this week in The Lou. The Rams, though intimidating on the edge thanks to Robert Quinn and Chris Long, are highly exploitable on inside runs. Routinely gashed between-the-tackles, they've allowed 99.1 rushing yards per game and 14 touchdowns to RBs. Equally encouraging for Thomas, St. Louis 5.2 receptions per game to rushers, the 10th-most in the league. A critical part of the Saints' screen game, he could inflict heavy damage via the air. He'll, as usual, work in tandem with Darren Sproles and Mark Ingram, but underutilized the past couple weeks, PT gasses up and rolls over Rams."

S"It's time to give credit where credit is due, gamer. Mathews, tossed under a bus and driven over repeatedly by scorned owners, is undergoing a career revival. Healthy, finally getting fed and again becoming an integral part of the pass game, he has quietly delivered RB2-level production over the past several games. Since Week 6, he's averaged 4.7 yards per carry, 92.8 total yards per game and splashed six four times. His subsequent 12.3 points per game output during that stretch ranks No. 18 among RBs, besting Frank Gore, Alfred Morris and Le'Veon Bell. With faint playoff hopes alive, the Chargers travel to Denver in a classic David vs. Goliath matchup in prime time. In an attempt to chill Peyton Manning on the sidelines, expect Mathews and tag-team partner Danny Woodhead to be the focus of Mike McCoy's game-plan. In the first matchup, the resurrected rusher gained just 61 yards on 15 touches, but did find the end-zone. Despite the tough road environment, he should be even better the second time around. Over the past three weeks, the Broncos have yielded 4.58 yards per carry and four 11-plus point RBs. Plug him in."

S"Typically, catching crabs is a rather unpleasant experience, but for owners itching for a title, it will be quite pleasurable. Shaking off the rust in his first two games since rupturing his Achilles in June, the tacky-handed receiver has barely made a peep. Against St. Louis and a very stingy Seattle secondary, he attracted 12 targets, catching six passes for 108 yards and zero touchdowns. However, this is the week forward-thinkers' patience is finally rewarded. Because Crabtree is still rounding into form, it's likely Darrelle Revis will shadow Anquan Boldin almost exclusively Sunday. That happens, and the former Red Raider should become the apple of Colin Kaepernick's eye. Ancillary corners Jonathan Banks and Leonard Johnson have surrendered a combined 64.2 catch%age, 13.0 yards per catch and an 87.4 QB rating to their assignments. Several secondary receivers, including Nate Burleson, Brandon LaFell, Riley Cooper and Jermaine Kearse, totaled appreciable numbers against them. Due to the duo's giving ways, it's highly conceivable Crabtree entices double-digit targets and lands inside the WR top-20 for the first time this season."

S"Of late, Ryan Tannehill has drawn more attention for his DICK's trick-shots, but his on-field production also deserves plenty of accolades. The sophomore passer has willed his team into the wildcard conversation, chewing up chunks of real estate with his arm and legs. As a result of the QB's torrid play, Hartline has caught fire. Targeted 28 times over the past three weeks, he's hauled in 19 receptions for 256 yards and two touchdowns. He did very little in New England Week 8, totaling a lowly four receptions for 37 yards. However, with Aqib Talib likely to drape Mike Wallace, Hartline should take advantage of his one-on-one opportunities against Kyle Arrington. On the year, the Pats corner has conceded a 58.6 catch rate and 100.7 QB rating to his assignments. Have a Hart, especially in PPR leagues."

S'With a name that makes announcers and spelling bee contestants sweat, Ogbonnaya, no matter if you pronounce it correctly (The \xe2\x80\x98g\xe2\x80\x99 is silent, by the way) is a name trophy-seeking owners should get to know. Over the past four weeks, he\xe2\x80\x99s made little fantasy noise despite seeing 44-plus snaps three times. During that stretch, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t break the plane once and averaged a pedestrian 53.3 total yards per game on roughly 8-10 touches per contest. The former Longhorn isn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly special, but he\xe2\x80\x99s fabulous in the pass game and generates appreciable yards on downhill runs (4.67 yards per carry). Most importantly for playoff purposes, he could be a difference maker. Willis McGahee, concussed last week against New England, is in a race to pass league protocol. If the RB relic is unavailable, which is a strong possibility, Ogbonnaya would be in line to rack 15-18 touches against a Chicago defense that\xe2\x80\x99s resembled the Bernstein Bears. Since Week 9, rushers have trounced the Mice of the Midway, netting an unreal 6.11 yards per carry. When future HOFer Benny Cunningham rolls up 109 yards (on just 13 carries) and a TD against you, that sums it up. Monitor practice reports closely this week, but if OGBYN is thrust into a lead role, he\xe2\x80\x99s a Brown bound to pack a vicious bite. (as starter)'

S'It may seem unintuitive to place Brady on this list. After all, his searing stretch over the past five weeks (No. 3 among QBs since Week 9) would suggest predicting a sub 20-point performance is nothing more than a shameless attempt to generate clicks. Admittedly, that might be partially true, but there\'s sound reasoning behind his \'Lame\' designation. The two-time MVP told WEEI Monday, the Pats "are going to have to make do" with "combinations" sans Rob Gronkowski, but expressed confidence he and his teammates will adapt. With Julian Edelman and Shane Vereen sizzling, the short-pass attack definitely won\'t suffer, however, an increased reliance on Stevan Ridley and the ground game could become a necessity. Point blank, unless Aaron Dobson is injected with Randy Moss\' archived DNA from 2008 or Kenbrell Thompkins resembles the unstoppable target from the preseason, Brady has no reliable deep-threat, a clear weakness Miami is sure to take advantage of. Quite possibly the most underrated secondary in the league, the Dolphins have surrendered just 6.9 yards per attempt and three multi-TD passers the entire year. Corners Brent Grimes, who ranks No. 4 in coverage according to Pro Football Focus, and Jimmy Wilson have been very unrelenting. Brady was abominable, with Gronk, against the \'Fins in Week 8, totaling a hideous 116-1-1 line in Foxboro. The second tango on South Beach could be equally ugly. Shiver in your Uggs, Brady backers.'

S"After exploding for 157 total yards and a score against Atlanta two weeks ago, many, including this balding Massengill, bought tickets for the Spiller Florida Fantasy Redemption Tour. Taking on the explosive appearance of his former self and blessed with a superb Sunshine State slate (at TB, at Jax, vs. Mia), it seemed highly plausible he would resemble the RB1 we all projected preseason he would be. Then last week happened. Against the Bucs Spiller and his Bills teammates had their eyes on the offseason. Turnovers, miserable offensive execution and poor run-blocking negatively influenced the rusher's final line. On 12 touches he finished with 48 yards. Disappointing. Only weeks ago, the 2013 Jags were tabbed one of the worst teams in NFL history. Blown out routinely, they were this generation's '76 Bucs. But, winners in four of their past five, Gus Bradley has quickly turned the tables. No longer pushovers on defense, the Jags have batted down balls and plugged gaps. Over their past five games, they've surrendered 2.79 yards per carry, 90.0 total yards per game and two TDs to RBs. That's it. Still locked in a timeshare with Fred Jackson and given the unsavory matchup against one of the league's hottest teams, on the road, and, suffice it to say, the 'toxic' version of Spiller is bound to reappear."

S"Brown's season has been quite unpredictable. Though he was expected to play second fiddle to David Wilson, many, including yours truly, sung his praises preseason, saying he would be a highly reliable producer in TD-heavy leagues. However, bitten by the injury imp yet again, his chance to graduate from the sleeper class was temporarily derailed. But now the workhorse, he's finally cashed in. In five starts, he's tallied 4.28 yards per carry, 100.8 total yards per game and scored three times, an output worthy of a top-15 RB ranking. Still, Brown shouldn't be trusted as anything more than a FLEX option in 12-teamers this week. Seattle did surrender 110 rushing yards to Frank Gore in Week 14, but, including that soft effort, the 'Hawks have surrendered a bland 4.02 yards per carry to RBs over their last three. More impressively, they've not allowed a rushing TD since Week 7 and the sixth-fewest fantasy points to rushers on the season. Because of Eli Manning's dreadful execution, it would be no surprise if defensive coordinator Dan Quinn creeps extra safeties into the box to contain New York's most consistent offensive weapon. He'll be decent, but mediocrity can lead to elimination this time of year."

S"Does Rob Lowe age? Does Bob Costas' hair move? Is Green incapable of being a fantasy dud? The answer to these perplexing questions, a resounding NO. Undoubtedly, the former first-round pick is one of the purest talents in the game. His name deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Calvin Johnson, Larry Fitzgerald and, quite possibly, Josh Gordon. His incredible length, athleticism and ball-tracking skills are nearly unmatched. However, he isn't invincible, particularly against a common foe that's had his number of late. Green has found the end-zone in three of his past five meetings against Pittsburgh, but he's averaged a pedestrian 4.8 receptions for 57.6 yards per game during that stretch. Owned by Ike Taylor and William Gay back in Week 2, he was held to a measly six receptions for 41 yards on 14 targets. As usual, the workload will be there, but don't be surprised if the Steelers give him the Mike Wallace treatment, mobbing him with safety help over the top. In what should be a cornea-burning affair in the Steel City, Green falls outside the WR top-20 for the fifth time this season."

S"Mike Glennon's once unyielding obsession with V-Jax has turned into a passing infatuation. From Weeks 4-8, the rookie passer looked the receiver's way a mind-blowing 15.0 times per game, connecting 26 times for 358 yards and four scores. Since then, however, their on-field relationship has become rocky. No longer the center of his world, Glennon has targeted Jackson 6.7 times per game over the past six weeks. The wideout's resulting 8.8 fantasy points per game during that span barely ranks him inside the WR top-30 in Yahoo leagues. No question, V-Jax has excelled in generous matchups, but when toe-to-toe with an unfavorable foe, he's floundered. San Francisco, unfortunately, is one opponent not to mess with. Darrelle Revis and Patrick Peterson may garner all the attention, but Tramaine Brock also deserves to be spotlighted. The blanketing corner, who ranks No. 3 in coverage according to PFF, has conceded a 52.6 catch%age and 70.0 QB rating to his assignments. Since Week 10, Brian Quick is the only wide receiver to score double-digit fantasy points against the Niners. If you want to sip the championship bubbly, avoid V-Jax."

S"Recall just two short years ago, the then Bill was a top-12 fantasy quarterback. Though short-armed and marginally accurate, the bearded wonder tossed 24 touchdown passes and averaged a respectable 252.9 combined yards per game. The Harvard product isn't particularly flashy in any single category, but he's intelligent, extends plays with his legs and hits his spots accurately in the short-field, an ideal fit for Dowell Loggains' dink-and-dunk offense. Repeatedly finding underneath weapons Kendall Wright and Delanie Walker and occasionally stretching Ds with bombs to Justin Hunter, he's surpassed the 20 fantasy points threshold in three of his past five starts. He only tallied 17.7 standard points in his last meeting with the Colts, but with Vontae Davis ailed by a groin injury and the Colts defense, in general, suffering, he should finish inside the QB top-15 in Week 13. Over the past five weeks, Indy has surrendered 301.2 passing yards and a 9:1 TD:INT split to QBs, equal to the fifth-most fantasy points allowed. Fitzpatrick, like Lucky Charms, will taste magically delicious for playoff-hopeful owners who roll the dice."

S'Over the past several weeks, Spiller\'s fantasy value has done backstrokes in a cesspool. Limited by a high-ankle sprain and locked into a complementary role to Fred Jackson, the once promising first-round pick has paid his buyers in Monopoly money. Indicative in his massive drop-off in forced missed tackles (2012: 25.6%, 2013: 10.5-percent), he\'s resembled a shell of the explosive, shifty RB of last year. Subsequently, his 6.8 per game average in standard formats is exactly half what he averaged in his breakout campaign a season ago. Alongside Trent Richardson and Ray Rice, he\'s arguably the biggest fantasy turkey of the year. But don\'t carve him up just yet. On Monday, Spiller told a local radio station the Bills need to "get back to the bread and butter" of their offense, running the football. Now at or near 100-percent, he and Jackson should have little difficulty fulfilling that wish. Gashed repeatedly between the tackles, the Falcons have given up 4.89 yards per carry, 177.4 total yards per game and five touchdowns to RBs since Week 8, equal to the fourth-most fantasy points allowed to the position. In the Land of Cracked-Out Mayors, Spiller saves some face.'

S"An early-season waivers sensation, Boom-Boom lived up to his nickname punishing opponents Week 2-Week 4. During that three-game stretch he scored double-digit points in each contest, temporarily graduating from the FLEX-only ranks. However since then, Powell has produced more gloom than boom. Over his past eight games, he's failed to find the end-zone, averaged just 3.5 yards per carry and totaled a useless 46.5 total yards per game. But with Chris Ivory a major question mark due to an ankle injury, he could reemerge at the most opportune time. The Dolphins, one of the stiffest run defenses in the league last year, have struggled mightily. Trent Richardson (Week 1) and DeAngelo Williams (Week 12) are the only No. 1s not to net at least 11 fantasy points against them. Overall, Miami has conceded 4.28 yards per carry, 151.1 total yards per game and 12 touchdowns to RBs, equal to the seventh-most fantasy points allowed. Because of the favorable matchup, likely uptick in touches and New York's stellar offensive line, the Jet could host a Fish fry on Sunday. Gamble with confidence."

S'Springsteen classic "Streets of Fire" best describes the Raiders\' recent play. With Denarius Moore dealing with a bum shoulder, Streater has forged an instant bond with rookie passer Matt McGloin. Over the past two weeks, he\'s racked 17 targets, hauled in 11 receptions for 177 yards and scored a touchdown. Because Moore\'s status remains in doubt, Streater could sear again, this time on Thanksgiving. If the Dallas defense was a Turkey Day side it would have to be gravy. Dunk your fantasy commodity into it and he\'s bound to taste that much better. On the year, the \'Boys have surrendered the sixth-most yards to wideouts. Since Morris Claiborne\'s demotion four weeks ago, they have shown some improvement. Still, Brandon Carr and Orlando Scandrick have allowed a combined catch rate just over 59%. Given the inefficiencies of Oakland\'s pass defense and McGloin\'s infatuation for Streater, the widely available target has reasonable odds of cracking the WR top-30 in consecutive weeks. Debate his merits in 12-team and deeper leagues.'

S'What does Boykin have to do to earn your respect? Shovel your driveway? Take the dog for a walk? Hold down Tom Brady and shave his Summer\'s Eve-styled salad off his head? I realize many owners wallowing in the basement have already checked out, but it\'s asinine Boykin, who\'s filled in brilliantly for injured slot man Randall Cobb, continues to be eligible for this list. No matter if it\'s Aaron Rodgers, Scott Tolzien or Matt Flynn under center, the man has produced. Since Week 7, he\'s tallied 7.8 targets, 5.5 receptions and 78.3 yards per game. Yes, he only has a pair of touchdowns over that six-game span, but it\'s hard to dispute his reliability in PPR formats. According to Mike McCarthy, A-Rod\'s chances of suiting up are "slim to none," but Flynn and Boykin should pick up where they left off in last week\'s sister-kissing OT outcome against Minnesota. During the past eight weeks, no secondary has yielded more fantasy points to wide receivers than Detroit. And it really isn\'t close. On the year, corners Chris Houston and Rashean Mathis have allowed 16.1 yards per catch and a QB rating of 101.5 to their assignments. If you relish winning, drop a quarter in the slot.'

S"Every time the Bears defense takes the field Wilber Marshall weeps uncontrollably. That's how appalling they've been. Depleted by injuries, Chicago has become the Mice of the Midway. Across the board, they've executed horribly, giving up large chunks in all facets of the game. For an ultra-versatile, incredibly-explosive emerging player like Patterson, it's a true dream matchup. Over the past two weeks, the rookie has become an integral part of the Vikings offense. Though he hasn't lit up fantasy scoreboards (11-82-0), he's attracted 20 targets, supplanting Jerome Simpson on the depth-chart. Outside leagues that score for return yardage, he's offered minimal utility, but if he entices another 8-10 targets, it's entirely conceivable he finishes inside the WR top-36 this week. Yes, his QB is still Christian Ponder, but due to the Bears' shortcomings on run D, it would be no surprise if Bill Musgrave finally gets creative with his deadliest weapon."

S"Forget Mighty Wings or Yahoo Fantasy, Kaepernick should be a pitchman for ex-lax. The passer, who was a highly touted QB1 on draft day, has soiled his pants repeatedly this season. On pace for just 3,479 combined yards and 24 total touchdowns, he hasn't taken the quantum leap many expected in Year 3. Misfired passes, a decreased emphasis on the read-option and unfavorable in-game circumstances are primarily to blame. Off his finest fantasy effort in weeks (235-3-0-20) and with Michael Crabtree slated to make his 2013 debut, many are prepared to welcome him back with open arms, but cool your jets. This is the same unreliable quarterback who hasn't scored 20 points in a week five times, his first tango against the Rams (167-2-0-11) included. St. Louis hasn't exactly lit the world on fire on pass defense, surrendering 352 and 351 yards to Andrew Luck and Josh McCown over the past two weeks. However, Chris Long and company have done a terrific job containing dual-threat QBs, evident in their execution against Cam Newton (204-1-0-26), Russell Wilson (139-2-0-16) and Jake Locker (185-0-2-10-1). In a contest where San Fran could build an early insurmountable lead against the likely Zac Stacy-less Rams, Kaepernick morphs back into a game-manager."

S'Though 0-for-2 on McCoy Lame calls this year, the third time will be the charm for yours truly. The first RB to reach the 1,000-yard mark on the ground this year, the popular first-round pick has actually met expectations, a rarity considering the high bust-rate among top picks. But this week McCoy could get McCooked. Against a very underrated Arizona defense few holes will materialize. On the year, the Cardinals have limited opposing RB1s to a mere 3.14 yards per carry, three touchdowns and 63.2 total yards per game. Multidimensional rushers Reggie Bush, Pierre Thomas and Maurice Jones-Drew all struggled against them, failing to score 10 fantasy points in standard formats. No question, a hefty workload is in the offing, but in what should be a lower scoring than advertised affair, McCoy finishes with his fourth mediocre fantasy total in 12 tries.'

S"With a fumble lost in three consecutive games, suffice it to say, Stevan cannot be trusted to safely transport the turkey from oven to table at the Ridley household this Thanksgiving. Eating from a bowl in Bill Belichick's doghouse, the once prized rusher has been quite the rollercoaster ride. A touchdown-scoring machine Weeks 6-11, it looked as though he was back on track after a sluggish start. However, benched last week after logging just four carries, his playing time is in serious jeopardy. According to ESPN Boston and based on Josh McDaniels' veiled comments Tuesday, it seems likely The Hoodie will rotate Ridley, Brandon Bolden, LeGarrette Blount and Shane Vereen on early downs and in short-yardage situations, a change in course which will surely greatly reduce the former starter's role. Even in a friendly matchup \xe2\x80\x93 Houston has allowed 4.87 yards per carry to RBs since Week 8 \xe2\x80\x93 I would be completely floored if he receives more than 10-12 carries. Unless you're purposely trying to tank the week to improve your opening round playoff matchup, do not play the Riddler."

S"Pigging out in the targets department over the past several weeks, Jackson and Mike Glennon have established quite the chemistry. Since Week 4, the rookie has zeroed in on his best playmaker 10.8 times per game. However, the high volume hasn't translated to enormous fantasy numbers. Against the weak secondaries of Philly and Atlanta he dominated, accounting for 29 receptions, 417 yards and five touchdowns. But when matched against stiffer competition, he's proven largely mediocre. Arizona, Miami, Seattle and, his Week 13 opponent, Carolina, each held V-Jax under 80 yards. The Panthers D has been marvelous across the board this season, particularly in downfield coverage. Captain Munnerlyn and Drayton Florence have allowed a combined 10.1 yards per catch to their assignments. Overall, only three receivers have crossed the chalk against them, the fewest WR scores yielded by a team this year. Slumping a bit of late \xe2\x80\x93 he's recorded seven fantasy points or less in three of his past four \xe2\x80\x93 Jackson should be considered a marginal WR3 this week."

S"Pittsburgh's secondary, torched like chestnuts roasting on an open fire, have been burnt to a crisp in recent weeks. Aaron Dobson (5-130-2), Danny Amendola (4-122-1), Calvin Johnson (6-179-1) and, most recently, Josh Gordon (14-237-1) each went off, finishing inside the WR top-10 in their respective weeks. Though Ike Taylor hasn't earned his paycheck, owners shouldn't get overly giddy about Smith. A season ago, the Ravens dropped long bombs repeatedly on their opponents. Joe Flacco and Smith were an unstoppable combination, especially during the playoffs. But those days are long in the past. This year, the pair have rarely connected downfield. Flacco, who completed 40.2% of his attempts beyond 20 yards a season ago, is just 12-of-57 in the category through 11 games. In his first meeting with Pittsburgh, Smith hauled in an underwhelming three catches for 61 yards. Worse yet, he hasn't found the end-zone or eclipsed the 65-yard mark in three-straight against the division rival. Thanksgiving night, Smith, not the 10,000 calories you just consumed, will give his owners a nasty case of indigestion."

S"Over the past week the NFL did a marvelous job reminding everyone in the greater Denver area just how spectacular Flacco really is. His giant-sized image adorned downtown buildings and even the exterior of Sports Authority Field. Considering the wounds from last season's divisional playoff loss are still fresh, the NFL's knee to the groin to the Orange faithful was an act worthy of capital punishment. Hey, blame the Orioles. Though the bull's eye on the Ravens QB is rather pronounced, he's in line to again bombard the Broncos. Yes, he lost roughly 40% of his receiving production from a season ago (Dennis Pitta and Anquan Boldin), but with Torrey Smith and Ray Rice still on roster, he shouldn't flounder when the matchup warrants. Denver presents such an opportunity. Down Von Miller (suspension) and no longer fielding the services of Elvis Dumervil, the Broncos pass rush is far from intimidating, which spells bad news against a QB that typically disembowels Ds when given time. Recall last fall, he posted an impeccable 16:0 TD:INT split on 123 pass attempts beyond 20 yards. More worrisome for Denver, it could be without corner Champ Bailey who remains very iffy with a lingering foot injury. If the veteran is inactive, Chris Harris and Dominque Rodgers-Cromartie, who last year ranked No. 40 in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus, will have their hands full. For one night only, Baltimore's 120.6 million-dollar man will be worth every penny."

S'Incognito for much of the summer, Bradshaw, nursing a surgically repaired right foot, didn\'t log a single snap in any one of Indy\'s four dress rehearsals. However, he ramped up his practice regimen, donning full pads two weeks ago. Colts head coach Chuck Pagano, not worried about Bradshaw\'s sluggish recovery, fully expects him to be ready for the opener against Oakland. Though he did run with the second team earlier this week, the Indy Star predicts the ex-Giant will immediately command the "lion\'s share" of touches. The Colts gave him a one-year deal for a reason. In other words, Vick Ballard should likely wrest away only 5-8 carries per game, possibly at the onset. When healthy, Bradshaw is one of the game\'s most underappreciated backs. Tough between the tackles, a quality receiver out of the backfield and superb in blitz pick-up, he\'s very well-rounded. Remember in 14 games with the Giants last year, he ranked inside the RB top-20 in per game average. In Pep Hamilton\'s somewhat conservative two-TE offense, he should be a focal point, especially this week. From top to bottom, the Raiders are an abomination. Overly generous to RBs last year (Ninth-most fantasy points allowed), they should again wallow near the bottom of the league versus the run. The last time Oakland finished outside the top-10 in fantasy points allowed to RBs (2002), people actually listened to Nickelback. In what should be a lopsided affair, the Colts rusher ensures Oakland\'s futility continues.'

S'In PPR formats, the Cal product will prove ironclad. Down Rob Gronkowski for at least the first 2-3 weeks of the regular season and with a young, inexperienced WR corps outside Danny Amendola to target, Tom Brady may soon play a game of pitch-and-catch with New England\'s "joker." Throughout the preseason and training camp, Vereen was utilized all over the field as a multidimensional weapon. He lined out wide, in the slot and caught swing passes out of the backfield. Because of his Reggie Bush-like skill set, he\'s an extremely difficult assignment, especially operating underneath against zones and in man-on-man coverage. A season ago, the Bills were very fantasy friendly allowing the second-most fantasy points to RBs. Stevan Ridley and Danny Woodhead, whose role Vereen is taking over, combined for five touchdowns and 288 yards from scrimmage in two games against them. Given his elusiveness, speed and sharp routes, linebackers Kiko Alonso and Jerry Hughes will have their hands full. FLEX him with confidence in 12-team PPR leagues.'

S"The fantasy community may be down with Antonio Brown, but few have jumped to the side of Sanders. With Mike Wallace soaking up rays on South Beach, owners should. The third-year target worked in the slot 67% of the time last year, posting a respectable 62.5 catch rate. This year he'll work mostly out wide, an area where he could attract 7-plus targets per game, particularly early on. Sans projected workhorse Le'Veon Bell, the Steelers will rely heavily on Ben Roethlisberger's arm. Yes, the offensive line would struggle fending off a slow-charging group of preschoolers, but high-volume situations could become commonplace. Keep in mind the Steelers defense, the crustiest unit in the league, isn't exactly full of spring chickens. Expected to draw Alterraun Verner, a corner local beat-writers feel is an ill-fit for Tennessee's newly installed press scheme, No. 88 could become the apple of Ben's eye. Last year, Verner yielded a bland 63.1 catch rate. Ponder Sanders' services as a WR3 in deeper leagues."

S"Larry Fitzgerald and buzzy sleeper Michael Floyd garnered plenty of attention in drafts this season, but the overlooked Roberts could also make considerable noise from the get go. The Citadel product is a crafty route-runner who can hold his own inside and outside the hashmarks. Despite the revolving door of suck at QB last year, he quietly tallied a laudable 64-759-5 line, including 14 receptions for 131 yards in two games versus the Rams. With Rob Housler very questionable due to a high-ankle sprain and given the offensive line's likely struggles against St. Louis' aggressive pass rush, he could see an uptick in targets working primarily in the short field. If Levi Brown fails to adequately protect the blind-side like he did in preseason action, Carson Palmer will need to get rid of the ball quickly. Even when the passer has time, Roberts should inflict measurable damage. Corners Cortland Finnegan and Janoris Jenkins surrendered a combined 67.5 catch rate to their assignments last year, many of those receptions surrendered to slot receivers. Heavily debate his services at WR3/FLEX in competitive PPR formats."

S"Pryor is essentially Oakland's version of Tim Tebow or Joe Webb. In reality, he's an incredibly raw passer who would fail to hit the Golden Gate Bridge square in the rivets from five yards out. However, in fantasy, he's a tantalizing dual threat capable of developing into a poor man's Cam Newton. Though woefully inaccurate and relatively inexperienced, he's a strong play in two-QB leagues. Yes, really. With Dwight Freeney no longer on roster, the Colts' pass rush outside Robert Mathis is no longer frightening. If the Raiders shaky offensive line can occasionally stand tall, Pryor could benefit from numerous clean pockets. If not, it may actually improve his scoring prospects. When flushed, the ex-Buckeye is a terrific instinctual runner. He runs with plus-burst, cutting ability and vision. Overlooked by most, Pryor was fantasy fantastic in his lone start last year notching a 150-2, 49-1 line against the Chargers, the seventh-best output by Week 17 passers. Dennis Allen is keeping his starting QB close to the vest, but based on offensive coordinators Greg Olson's recent admission the Raiders need playmakers and a San Fran Chronicle report, Pryor will get the call. In a contest Oakland will almost certainly play from behind in, he's destined for garbage-time greatness. He may only complete 45% of his attempts, but his legs will make him one of next week's hottest waiver commodities."

S'Chances are those who acquired the \'elite\' QB\'s services likely spent an exorbitant pick. His blood-stirring finish to the 2012 season \xe2\x80\x93 over the final eight games he and Russell Wilson tied for best per game average among QBs \xe2\x80\x93 understandably spiked his draft value. However, yours truly would rather swim from Miami to Cuba, in shark-infested waters mind you, than trust Newton in Week 1. Seattle\'s dynamic duo at corner (Brandon Browner and Richard Sherman) combined with an aggressive pass rush presents a daunting matchup for a quarterback who\'s been wildly inconsistent in the pass department in his first two years in the league. Last year, Newton scored a vomit-inducing 11.3 fantasy points in standard formats (141 pass yards, 42 rush yards, 0 TDs) against the \'Hawks in Charlotte. Rattled much of the day, he completed just 41.3% of his attempts. Over the entirety of the season, Pete Carroll\'s club surrendered only four 20-point QB efforts. Considering Cam\'s lack of weapons outside a well-aged Steve Smith and inconsistent Greg Olsen, he\'s a very risky play. Some will scream from the highest rooftop to "Always start your studs!," but every player, except possibly Drew Brees, is vulnerable to an underwhelming performance. In a head-to-head Week 1 matchup, give me Joe Flacco, Michael Vick or Cowboys killer Eli Manning (250.4 pypg, 2.3 pass td per game in 14 career starts) over Cam.'

S"The buzz around Johnson entered full-on 'dance with your pants off' mode Preseason Week 2. Against a Redskins front-line that should be as overly accommodating to RBs as it was last year, he exploited a massive cut-back lane, embarrassed a would-be tackler in the open field and sprinted to the end-zone for a 58-yard touchdown. Naturally, reckless predictions were immediately tossed out all over the Twittersphere. Admittedly, the Titans revamped o-line looks much improved. When Mike Munchak, arguably one of the greatest lineman to play the game, is your head coach it should. However, the elderly Steelers pride themselves in stuffing the run. Over their past 44 games, a period stretching back to 2011, they've conceded only three 100-yard games to RBs. Vulnerable at times last year, they should be much improved. Nose tackle Steve McLendon, expected to be PIT's every-down man-eater, is a major upgrade over Casey Hampton. Expect Johnson, who's averaged a lowly 3.8 yards per carry and 74.0 total yards per game in five career games against the Steel Curtain, to underachieve. Plus, it's also important to take into account the Shonn Greene poach factor. With CJ2Lame outside my RB top-20 this week, Reggie Bush, Lamar Miller and prime-cut sleeper Ben Tate are stronger plays."

S"New Orleans' Mighty Mouse is a player who can squeeze into the tightest spaces. Thickly built, highly explosive and extremely slippery, he's one of the game's finest receiving backs. Generally speaking, he's a matchup nightmare for linebackers. However, during his brief tenure in New Orleans the rival Falcons have really had his number. In three career games versus the Dirty Birds, he's totaled a mere 3.6 receptions and 57.7 yards per game with one touchdown. Within Atlanta's base 4-3 defense, Sean Weatherspoon is particularly adept at shadowing receivers out of the backfield. According to Pro Football Focus, the linebacker was the 10th-best player at his position defending the pass last year. Given the LB's adaptability, the increased usage of Mark Ingram as a receiver, Pierre Thomas' involvement and Sproles' uninspiring history, the short-stacked back shouldn't be considered a reliable option in opening week action. A points bonanza is likely to break out on Bourbon Street, but beyond 12-team PPR leagues with a FLEX spot, he's bench worthy."

S"Among this past offseason's acquisitions, Welker was arguably one of the biggest. At least, that's what the mainstream media would lead you to believe. Compared to his 110-catch days in New England, the slot machine's production is bound to decline ... dramatically. With Demaryius Thomas, Eric Decker and a very underrated Julius Thomas on roster, Peyton Manning has simply too many mouths to feed. Montee Ball's possible emergence is also a value squelcher. Welker won't completely fall off the map, but projecting 85-plus catches this season is an exercise in futility. The Thursday night broadcast will surely cast a spotlight on him, however, modest results are likely versus Baltimore. Welker torched them last year hauling in 16 catches for 259 yards and a TD in two meetings. But sans its now retired spiritual leader Ray Lewis and with Terrell Suggs at full-strength, the Ravens are faster across the middle than they were last year, which should help them control the short-field. Also weighing his likely minor role inside the red zone, Double Dubs is a fringe WR3 in 12-team formats this week."

S"As stated many times in this space, V-Jax is the El Toro of fantasy wideouts. The name of his game is inconsistency. Since 2011, he's failed to crack 8.0 fantasy points (Non-PPR) in 46.8% of his games. 'Dems da breaks for a big-play receiver who runs a limited route tree. Every New York paper will tell you the Jets are a bigger laughing stock than Anthony Wiener, but there is talent in the defensive backfield. Prolific baby-maker Antonio Cromartie allowed just 12.8 yards per catch and a 46.0 catch rate to his assignments last year, the third-best output among corners who played at least 500 snaps. Expected to drape Jackson much of the game, he will likely keep the target under wraps. Though Doug Martin played sparingly in the preseason, he should be the focal point of Greg Schiano's game-plan. Similar to last year, the Jets first-string defense was routinely gashed in the trenches during preseason play. Taking into account the forces working against No. 83, T.Y. Hilton, Miles Austin and DeSean Jackson are safer plays."

S"When running in the open field Pryor looks like Chazz Michael Michaels on ice, an effortless glider. Including last week's rushing effort against the Steelers, almost all of it on one 93-yard record-setting TD run, the former Buckeye has totaled at least 31 ground yards in every game this season. Evident last Sunday against the stiffest secondary in the league, he remains a work in progress as a passer, but, to the QB's credit, he's made noticeable strides in his delivery, touch and accuracy. On the year, he's completed 63.1% of his attempts, a rate Tom Brady could only dream of. This week, his odds of hitting the mark are substantial. In eight games, five quarterbacks have totaled multi-TD efforts against the Eagles. Overall, they've given up 316 passing yards per game and 7.2 yards per attempt. Equally encouraging for TP, starting CBs Cary Williams and Bradley Fletcher have yielded a combined 59.4 catch percentage to their assignments. Peyton Manning and Matthew Stafford owners in the market for an adequate bye-week filler should bet on the Silver and Black."

S"If you're sick and tired of the relentless Mathews man-love, it's understandable. Over the past several seasons, more time and energy has been wasted in this space about the RB than anyone else. It's disturbing, I know, but it's time to give the guy some props. Prior to the Chargers' bye week, Mathews strung together consecutive 100-yard games for the first time in two years. Though he hasn't dominated on a weekly basis and has been occasionally poached by Danny Woodhead at the goal-line, the Bolt has displayed excellent burst and toughness between the tackles. Most importantly, his clavicles have remained intact. However, fresh off the bye, he should again be a focal point of Mike McCoy's game plan. On the year, the Redskins have surrendered 4.45 yards per carry, 153.8 total yards per game and 10 touchdowns to RBs, equal to the third-most fantasy points allowed. In fact, a rusher has scored at least 11 standard-league points against them in every game this season. Mathews has seen 41 fewer snaps than Woodhead, but odds are strong he'll log his third-straight game with 20-plus carries. The No. 24 RB in per game average in traditional scoring formats, he's quickly becoming an every week RB2. Rekindle the bromance."

S"As Don Corleone would say, revenge is a dish best served cold. Ivory, dealt from New Orleans to New York in exchange for a fourth-round pick last April, will be plenty motivated to offer a healthy serving. Off a throwback 34-carry game in Week 7, the Jets' battering ram barely saw the field a week ago, a victim of in-game circumstances. With New York buried early by Andy Dalton and the Bengals, he played on just 12 snaps, carrying the rock six times for 11 yards. If Antonio Cromartie and Dee Milliner leave their hard hats at home again this week, a similar scenario could develop. New Orleans, after all, is the league's most prolific passing offense. But in order to keep Drew Brees on the sidelines, Rex Ryan will surely dial up Ivory's number early and often. Under brother Rob Ryan's direction, the Saints have excelled defending the pass, but remain vulnerable in the trenches. On the season, they've allowed 4.47 yards per carry to RBs, five rushing TDs and 90.8 rushing yards per game. If the Jets D can stave off a large early deficit, Ivory is in position to splash six for the first time this year and finish well-inside the RB top-20."

S"A deceased skunk on the side of the road. That's the odor Bowe has emitted this year. KC's $55 million man has floundered, failing to gain adequate separation from defenders and, as a result, attracting targets from noodle-armed QB, Alex Smith. On the year, he's found the end-zone twice, has yet to surpass 70-yards in a game and ranks No. 74 among WRs in per game average. Barf. However, this week's matchup springs optimism. The Bills, coming off a five-TD thrashing at the hands of Drew Brees, have conceded 54 pass plays of 15-plus yards, the fourth-most in the NFL. Even when healthy Leodis McKelvin and Stephen Gilmore have largely rolled over against the pass. Nick Robey is the only Bills corner to rank inside the top-40 in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus. Overall, Buffalo ranks No. 1 in most fantasy points allowed to WRs. Smith has attempted just 16 passes beyond 20 yards in eight games, but given the delectable matchup, he may uncork, connecting with Bowe more than once downfield. Yes, your faith in him is practically nonexistent, but give RainBowe Bright one more chance."

S"Very quietly Wright has donned a plumed hat, fur coat and bejeweled cane, developing into a sure-fire PPR P-I-M-P. Jake Locker's main man has enticed at least six targets and hauled in five passes in every game since Week 2. The Lambs D was caught many off-guard Monday night against Seattle, stuffing the run early and often. However, pass coverage continued to be a major bugaboo, evident in Golden Tate's monster night. No Ram, not Trumaine Johnson, Cortland Finnegan or gum-flapper Janoris Jenkins, ranks inside the top-70 in pass coverage according to PFF. Combined the trio has given up a catch rate of 66.7% and QB rating of 100-plus to their assignments. In total, 11 wideouts have achieved 'Flame' status against St. Louis this year. Wright, who typically operates underneath averaging 10.8 yards per catch, is sure to nickle and dime the Rams all day long, especially with Locker playing so exceptionally of late. Count on him as a WR3 in 12-team and deeper PPR formats."

However, the FBS all-time leader in total offense isn\xe2\x80\x99t your every day recently promoted backup. Prior to Houston\xe2\x80\x99s Week 8 bye, he compiled terrific numbers on the road against a nasty Chiefs defense. Working primarily out of the 'gun, the Houston product resembled Kurt Warner at times, releasing the ball quickly and accurately. Though sacked five times, he averaged an impressive 10.84 yards per attempt totaling 271 yards, a touchdown and zero interceptions. His subsequent 110.6 QB rating was the fifth-best that week. Led by Vontae Davis, the Colts secondary, for the most part, has executed brilliantly this season. Russell Wilson and Peyton Manning are the only quarterbacks to tally multi-TD days against it. However, given the umbrella-like nature of Indy's scheme, Keenum, a mobile passer who typically makes his hay in the intermediate field, could gash it underneath. With Andre Johnson, DeAndre Hopkins, Garrett Graham and, hopefully, Arian Foster at his disposal, don\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if he shines under the prime-time lights."

S"Step back and examine Luck's situation. This is his first game without his most dependable weapon, Reggie Wayne. Though T.Y. Hilton is a marvelous deep-threat he is far from the complete receiver Wayne is. His other targets Darrius Heyward-Bey and Coby Fleener, who should never be trusted holding an infant, are not exactly sure-handed. And his running back, Trent Richardson, would likely fall backwards attempting to break through a wall of styrofoam bricks. Worse yet, the Texans rank fourth versus fantasy QBs. Hello, nightmare scenario. The No. 10 passer in per game average, Luck has only one 300-yard game to his name, but largely due to his underrated rushing ability, he's recorded four multi-TD performances this year. Equally impressive, he's increased his completion rate from 54.1 to 61.1. Still, his Week 9 matchup isn't conducive to outstanding fantasy results. Jonathan Joseph is again shutting opponents down. On the year, he's surrendered a 44.4 catch%age and 62.8 QB rating to his assignments. Overall, the Texans have allowed a lowly 6.47 yards per attempt and a pair of 20-point passers (Philip Rivers and Alex Smith) this season. With their backs against the wall, expect Ed Reed and company to rise to the occasion in a critical AFC South showdown."

S"Shady's second appearance on the Lames list the season would lead many to question my sanity. In a crippling bye week, no person in their right mind is even entertaining the idea of sitting the No. 8 RB (on a per game basis) in all of fantasy, a completely fair perspective. But for the purposes of this self-created game, I'm predicting McCoy owners will get the Charlie Brown trick-or-treatment, receiving an unwanted rock in their Halloween bag. Dennis Allen has done wonders with a Raiders run defense once the butt of many fantasy jokes. Since 2002, Oakland has ranked inside the top-10 in most fantasy points allowed to RBs every season. Unpredictably reversing course this season, it actually ranks in the top-half of fewest points conceded. No rusher has surpassed the 80-yard mark on the ground and only Jamaal Charles in Week 6 has eclipsed 100-total yards against the Silver and Black. Overall, they've surrendered 3.52 yards per carry to RBs this year. Stunning. The last time Nick Foles was under center, Week 7 versus Dallas, the Eagles offense struggled. McCoy finished with respectable numbers in PPR leagues (83 total yards, 6 catches), but his 8.1 points in standard settings failed to stir the drink. On the road, anticipate another lukewarm effort."

S"Generally speaking, no two games are ever the same in the NFL. Injuries, coaching strategies and unforeseen in-game circumstances makes every contest distinctively unique. However, Rice, who tallied a mere 47 yards without a score Week 2 versus Cleveland, could duplicate his previous dreadful effort. Limited by a hip injury for a time, which forced him into a timeshare with Bernard Pierce, and victimized by a porous offensive line (The Ravens rank No. 31 of 32 in run-blocking per Pro Football Focus), Rice has greatly underwhelmed this season. His 8.9 per game average in standard settings ranks No. 29 among RBs, a far cry from the Round 1 value most paid for. Cleveland, downright nasty against the run early in the season, has come unraveled of late defensively. Over the past five weeks, the Browns have yielded the eighth-most fantasy points to RBs. Still, they've allowed just 3.52 yards per carry to the position on the year. Linebacker Paul Kruger and nose tackle Phil Taylor grade out well-above the league average defending the run. In what will surely be a back-alley scrum of a game, the Raven will have owners saying 'nevermore.'"

S"Mom always told me to never eat yellow snow. She also advised me to never start a No. 1 receiver against Richard Sherman in Seattle. And, before you ask, yes, I still live in my parents' basement. Practically matchup proof this season, the once king of inconsistency has become Mr. Reliable, a near miraculous achievement considering Tampa's earlier QB strife. He's often climbed the ladder, hauled in ridiculous one-handed grabs and scored inside the position's top-10. Currently the No. 9 WR in Fantasyland on a per game basis, he's in the midst of his best season yet. Still, speaking as a matchup advocate, V-Jax presents plenty of risk in Week 9. Without Mike Williams, who was placed on injured reserve Tuesday, to act as a buffer and minus a stout run game, he will be the focus of defensive coordinator game-plans moving forward. Seattle's secondary has lived up to the hype this season. Sherman and Brandon Browner rank inside the top-20 in pass coverage per PFF. The former, especially lock-down, has yielded a tidy 53.6 QB rating to his assignments. Overall, only three wideouts have crossed the 75-yard mark against them. The future is bright for Mike Glennon, but in an ear-piercing environment and facing arguably the best defense in the league, the mozzarella stick melts. Subsequently, so will Jackson."

S'If the unstoppable, top-five version of Gronk resurfaces this week against the league\'s stingiest pass defense, "The Gronks" cartoon feature is sure to overtake "The Simpsons" as the greatest animated TV series in the history of humanity. Just how asphyxiating have the Steelers been against the pass this year? They\'ve allowed only 19 pass plays of 15-plus yards. That\'s 31 fewer plays than Chicago has given up in the category in the same number of games. Equally astonishing, no QB has thrown for more than 285 yards and only one passer, Matt Cassell of all people, has thrown for multiple touchdowns against them. Specific to tight ends, no player at the position has totaled seven fantasy points or more versus Pittsburgh, including Martellus Bennett, Jermaine Gresham and Kyle Rudolph. Suffocating. Given Tom Brady\'s (AKA "The Cowardly Lion\'s") massive slump and the daunting matchup, the tight end\'s Week 9 outlook is very ominous. Off his worst fantasy performance (5-2-27-0) since Week 2 of last year, this fantasy wonk isn\'t particularly high on Gronk.'

S"Wallowing in the basement of the AFC North is a surprising twist for one of the most successful franchises of the past decade. An ancient defense combined with inconsistencies on offense are the primary reasons for the reversal of fortune. Still, thrust into several come-from-behind situations, Big Ben has benefited from his defense's shoddy play. Averaging 291.3 passing yards per game, he's on pace for a career-high 616 pass attempts and 4,660 passing yards. Given the uncertainty at QB for Buffalo, Pittsburgh may actually dominate its Week 10 opponent, but it should build a substantial early lead by leaning on No. 7's arm. The Bills have allowed 55 pass plays of 15-plus yards, the fifth-most in the NFL. Specific to signal callers, they've also given up 267.1 passing yards per game and 20 vertical touchdowns, the most in the league. In nine games only Brandon Weeden and Alex Smith failed to record multi-TD performances against them. Off his second 400-yard game of the year, Big Ben should again showcase a fiery hand."

Brandon Jacobs and Peyton Hillis did a commendable job filling the void for injured starter David Wilson, but it's clear they were merely keeping the seat warm for Brown. Yes, it's true he would probably shatter a femur jumping into a pool of plastic balls, but he's undeniably the most talented runner currently on the Giants' roster. He's explosive, elusive and versatile, a legit three-down option. Recall a season ago, he broke seven runs of 15-plus yards on just 73 attempts. Brown told the Newark Star-Ledger Monday, he was 'eased' back into practice Monday, but it would be no stretch to think he grips the pigskin roughly 15-17 times Sunday. The Raiders have given up a bland 3.70 yards per carry to RBs on the year, but they've allowed at least four receptions to RB1s in four straight. Off a butt-whipping of epic proportions, Oakland is likely to get pounded by yet another NFC East foe. Roll the dice in deeper leagues."

S"R2D2 moving on a busted wheel. That's the image that reminds me of Trent Richardson's Greene's play over the past couple seasons. Though snail-like and generally mediocre at his previous stop (3.9 yards per carry), the thick-bodied rusher proved effective at times over the past two in the Big Apple, logging consecutive 1,000-yard campaigns, an output that gained an admirer in Nashville. Prior to Week 9 Mike Munchak boldly declared Greene, who had not seen action since Week 1, would receive 15 carries per game moving forward. He didn't quite shoulder that heavy of a load against the Rams, but his 66 total yards and a score on 10 touches rewarded owners who listened. Chris Johnson is entrenched as the lead dog, but Greene should continue to reprise the LenDale White role, functioning as the club's primary short-yardage and goal-line option. Matched against the repellent Jags, who rank No. 1 in most fantasy points yielded to RBs (10 rush TDs allowed) , he should see plenty of action in what should be a one-sided affair. Start him with the utmost confidence at the FLEX in 12-team and deeper leagues."

S"In a socialist offense where the love is spread nearly evenly, it's extremely difficult to predict exactly who will produce the most fantasy bang week-in, week-out, outside Jimmy Graham of course. However, in a matchup where everyone but rubbish pile Marques Colston has robust odds of exploding, Moore is a good bet to finish well-inside the WR top-30. Returning from a wrist injury two weeks ago, the crafty veteran rekindled his role as Drew Brees' money man underneath. Against the Bills and Jets he enticed 14 targets catching nine passes for 104 yards and a touchdown. With Colston (knee) and Darren Sproles (concussion) ailing, he could attract double-digit looks for the second straight week. Shown time and time again this season, a one-armed man could dissect Dallas' defense. No secondary has allowed more 15-plus yard pass plays. Orlando Scandrick has executed well, conceding just 8.6 yards per catch to his assignments, but Brandon Carr and especially Morris Claiborne have been overly generous. Combined the paltry pair have given up a 60.5 catch%age and 15.2 yards per catch to their assignments. In a Sunday night clash destined to have a multitude of fantasy scorgasms, Sir Lance-a-lot is sure to sit at the head of the round-table."

S"White-hot rookie QB under center? Check. Starting gig? Bingo. Ripe matchup? Hell (expletive) yes. Among the third class of tight ends, Graham could have the biggest day. He hasn't blown the doors off the joint with Case Keenum under center (7-84-0 the past two weeks), but he's solicited a healthy 14 targets during that stretch. This week, that number could spike significantly. On the fantasy highway, the Cardinals have pulled off to the side of the road and allowed numerous tight ends to race by them. Everyone from Jimmy Graham to Zach Miller has compiled fruitful production against the desert D, many of those even with Darryl Washington on the field. In total, TEs have been targeted 10.8 times per game racking 89.6 yards per game and eight touchdowns against Arizona equal to the most fantasy points surrendered to the position (by a wide margin). With Andre Johnson, off a spectacular 9-229-3 performance, the likely focus of Todd Bowles' defensive game-plan, Graham is sure to clean-up, particularly against zone coverage. Consider him an upside TE1 in Week 10."

S"Against a decimated Vikings secondary, big numbers could come from Washington's smallest package. Though the 34-year-old is a shell of the 93-1115-6 receiver he was three short years ago, he isn't entirely washed up. He's still quick off breaks, sports fairly reliable hands and is troublesome versus zone coverage. In his past five games, he's attracted just 15 total targets, a clear afterthought compared to Pierre Garcon and Jordan Reed. But the Vikings have been overly generous to slot receivers this year, a weakness RGIII will likely take advantage of. Corner Josh Robinson, who typically shadows the position, has surrendered an 86.4 catch%age and 127.3 QB rating to his assignments this year. Overall, slot machines have averaged 7.7 targets and 62.4 yards per game versus the Vikes this season. Last week was no exception. Tony Romo connected with short-field option Cole Beasley six times for 68 yards against Minnesota. Admittedly, most PPR zealots would rather receive a knock on the door from Richie Incognito than trust a well-aged receiver in the twilight of his career, but for those in dire straits, the veteran is worth a long look."

S"Whenever a fantasy owner sees a matchup against the Saints salivary glands begin to work overtime. Based on New Orleans' recent history, the Bayou Boys are generally soft defensively, the perfect ingredient for triggering a shootout. However, this season, that belief is steeped in fiction, not fact. Defensive coordinator Rob Ryan has done a masterful job transitioning the Fleur De Lis from a forgiving 4-3 to an assaulting 3-4 defense. On the season, 'Nawlins has forced nearly two turnovers per game while netting 3.25 sacks per contest. Against a QB known for crumbling under intense heat, expect Ryan to bring the house early and often. Under pressure 35.2% of the time this season, Romo has completed just 48.6% of his attempts in those situations. Still, he does deserve credit. Thanks to an atrocious Dallas D, he's failed to reach the 20-fantasy point threshold only twice this season (at KC, vs. Was). However, only Tennessee and Carolina (7) have given up fewer passing touchdowns than New Orleans (8). Matt Ryan and Jay Cutler are the only passers to register multi-TD games against it. In what will surely be a raucous road environment, keep your expectations for Romo tempered."

S"Cruisin' down South Beach last week, the youngster broke ankles and picked up points in his minivan, torching the Dolphins for 104 total yards and a pair of scores, his finest fantasy performance of the season. Gio, one of my favorite RBs in this year's draft class, is a dynamic talent blessed with an extra gear, sick juking ability and soft hands. He continues to work in tandem with BenJarvus Green-Ellis, but usually makes the most of his 13-15 touches per game. This week, however, presents a daunting task. No defense has surrendered fewer fantasy points to RBs than Baltimore. On the season, the Ravens have allowed just one RB touchdown, 3.67 yards per carry and 25.8 receiving yards to rushers. According to Pro Football Focus, Terrell Suggs and Elvis Dumervil rank No. 1 and No. 13, respectively, against the run, combining for 45 stops. Because of his pass-catching upside he's still a viable option in PPR settings. However, for the standard leaguers in attendance, he's likely to generate a rather unproductive line."

S'Typically, when RBs blow out the candles on the big 3-0, they go the way of that Nazi-sympathizer dude who drank from the wrong cup in "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade." Over the years, the list of rushers who did exactly that is rather lengthy. However, Jackson is an exception. Thought to be decomposed preseason, the geriatric back has played heroically while C.J. Spiller has battled through a high-ankle sprain. He\'s averaged 12.2 fantasy points per game in standard leagues, good for No. 13 among RBs. Though I greatly respect Jackson, this is the week he posts only modest numbers. Yes, Pittsburgh was pounded last Sunday giving up a franchise-record 55 points to the Patriots. But as Troy Polamalu admitted on \'The Dan Patrick Show\' earlier this week, the Steelers\' mistakes are fixable. Desperate for a W and at home, the local team busts open a can. More the Soft than the Steel Curtain in the trenches this season, Pittsburgh has yielded the eighth-most fantasy points to RBs. That stat, however, is a bit misleading. Rushing touchdowns allowed have been an issue, but it\'s given up a bland 4.08 yards per carry to plowshares. Toss in Spiller\'s sudden revival and expected increased role along with Buffalo\'s uncertainty at QB, and Jackson has reasonable odds of finishing outside the RB top-20 in Week 10.'

S"Without a doubt, Nelson is one of the finest deep-ball weapons in the game today. He possesses the necessary jets, ball-tracking skills and route-running ability to toast the competition. However, going from Aaron Rodgers, arguably the best pure passer in the league, to Seneca Wallace, an elderly vagabond who hasn't been relevant since 2011, is akin to dumping Olivia Wilde for the profuse-sweating woman that works the late-night Taco Bell drive-thru. Fourthmeal anyone? Wallace was an absolute hot mess after replacing Rodgers early in the first half last Monday night versus Chicago. He averaged a wretched 6.0 yards per attempt, completed only 57.9% of his attempts and was sacked four times. The matchup is incredibly favorable. No defense has surrendered more fantasy points to wide receivers this season than the Eagles. Corner Cary Williams ranks No. 101 out of 107 in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus. But the Philly secondary, particularly Bradley Fletcher, has shown improvement of late. Against the Giants and Raiders, the Eagles' past two opponents, no wide receiver reached the end-zone. The circumstances are unfortunate, but it's doubtful Wallace exceeds 25 pass attempts in Week 10. Expect more Eddie Lacy/James Starks, less Jordy."

S"Revis Island is far from a tropical paradise. Finally back to doing what he does best pressing opposing teams' top target, the corner, the No. 1 rated cover man in the league according to PFF, will likely smother Wallace on Sunday. Thrown at 30 times this season, he's conceded only 7.3 yards per catch to his assignments. Golden Tate, victimized by Darrelle Revis last week, was limited to just three catches for 29 yards. Wallace has made his displeasure known repeatedly this season, expressing his desire to be the featured receiver nearly every week. As a result, he's attracted plenty of targets, particularly since his public outcry four weeks ago. Since Week 5, he's garnered 11.0 targets, 5.2 receptions and 76.0 yards per game with a pair of touchdowns. However, because of who will likely shadow him, it's entirely possibly he'll log just a handful of targets this week. In a game no person outside the Sunshine State will care to witness, Brian Hartline and Charles Clay will be the apple of Ryan Tannehill's eye."

S'Just a few days ago, the veteran\'s status was in limbo. A painful nerve condition in his throwing shoulder, which triggered burning sensations up and down his arm, kept him under wraps. However, after undergoing a successful "experimental treatment" in a part of the country known for such exercises (Denver), he surprisingly returned to the lineup and experienced no repercussions. Against Washington, he completed 63.6 percent of his passes for 250 yards and two touchdowns. Most importantly, he highly involved both Michael Floyd and Larry Fitzgerald, a tandem that floundered with Drew Stanton and briefly Logan Thomas at the helm. Operating behind an improved offensive line, Palmer has played well in two games. He\'s delivered strikes often downfield (5-for-11 on passes beyond 20 yards), excelled on play-action (111.1 QB Rating) and functioned admirably under pressure. His resulting 23.2 fantasy points per game (vs. SD and Wash) ranks top-seven at the position. This week, another QB1 level performance is a strong likelihood. The Raiders, deceivingly stout against the pass entering Week 6, were exposed by Philip Rivers, surrendering 313 yards and three touchdowns. To be fair, T.J. Carrie has executed laudably (54.7 QB rating allowed), but Carlos Rogers and Tarell Brown, who\'ve given up 41 catches on 50 targets, certainly have not. Palmer, returning to the Black Hole for the first time since he last played there in 2012, lands a stinging blow. '

S'Over his seven-year career, Forsett, despite being productive as a starter, has been constantly questioned. His diminutive stature and slender frame led many to label him a change-of-pace rusher. However, the former Cal standout continues to silence his critics. He remains involved in a three-back rotation with Bernard Pierce and Lorenzo Taliaferro, but without a doubt the little guy has been the most consistently effective. Forsett would probably find it difficult busting through a pile of leaves, but his shiftiness and speed through the hole should not be underestimated. Among eligible RBs, he ranks top-15 in elusive rating (46.6) and breakaway percentage (45.5) according to Pro Football Focus. A top-20 rusher since taking on an expanded role in Week 2, he could penetrate the position\'s top-10 in Week 7. Atlanta is a sieve up front. No defense has allowed more fantasy points to the position. In total, RBs have rolled up 190.7 total yards per game and 11 scores against it with eight RBs achieving "Flame" status. On 14-18 touches, he lights up the virtual scoreboard. '

S"Unlike some head coaches (Hint: One likes to wear hoodies, the other rhymes with Chisenfunt), Mike McCarthy is a coach of his word. For the past couple weeks he's maintained his commitment to a two-back rotation. After last Sunday's near dead-even split between Eddie Lacy (39 snaps) and Starks (38), the coach obviously isn't waffling. Roughly 10-14 touches per game should be the norm for No. 44 rest of season. When toting the rock, Starks has displayed impressive power and burst. In what will be a surprise to most, he's recorded almost the same yards after contact rate (61.8) as Lacy (62.1). Sunday he could improve on that number. Carolina, defensively, has done a complete 180 from last fall. Luke Kuechly continues to rank highly against the run (No. 12 among all LBs), but going from strong to squishy, the Panthers, collectively, have conceded 5.5 yards per carry, 170 total yards per game and eight touchdowns to RBs. Only Atlanta has given up more fantasy points per game to the position. With two teams on bye, most owners have numerous options to employ at RB. Still, Starks is a FLEXY sexy option in almost any format. "

S"Quite possibly the MVP of the Rodney Dangerfield All-Stars, Jones is arguably the most disrespected commodity in the entirety of fantasy sports. If he suited up for a higher profiled club and caught passes from a proven passer, he would be coveted. Instead, owners, even those who repeatedly trot out the maddening likes of Keenan Allen, Cordarrelle Patterson and Percy Harvin, continue to give him the cold shoulder. Dumb. Whether PPR or standard, Jones has churned out WR2 numbers in 12-team leagues. Smelling like a rose in garbage time, he's tallied a near identical line as DeAndre Hopkins in one fewer game (35-26-328-3). Equally impressive, his 78.8 catch percentage ranks No. 5 among wideouts with at least 200 snaps. Arizona's ballyhooed secondary has failed. Rolled in flour and dropped in oil, Patrick Peterson and Antonio Cromartie are extra crispy. On the year, the duo has surrendered 17.34 yards per catch and a 117.8 QB rating. Yes Andre Holmes' role is growing and putting trust in a rookie quarterback's hands is always a risky proposition, but if Derek Carr can carry over momentum from last week's breakout, Jones crosses the chalk for the fourth time in six games.

S'From a pure talent standpoint Watkins is unequivocally the cream of this year\'s rookie wide receiver crop. His NASCAR wheels, ridiculous body control, ball-tracking skills and tacky hands should give defensive backs nightmares for years to come. Largely because E.J. Manuel would overthrow a Wampa from 10 yards out, Watkins played unevenly out of the gate. Kyle Orton, inserted into the lineup two weeks ago, also hasn\'t helped him establish consistency. With only a pair of touchdowns and two games of 40-plus yards to his name, he ranks outside the position\'s top-36. Despite the rollercoaster ride, Watkins is a strong play in Week 7. Minny DBs Xavier Rhodes and Josh Robinson have performed admirably in coverage, but if Watkins matches up with Captain Munnerlyn, he\'s sure to sink the corner\'s ship. Targeted 22 times, Munnerlyn has yielded 16 catches and a 137.9 QB rating. Overall, seven wideouts have posted "Flame" worthy numbers against Minnesota this year. Sensational Sammy will be the eighth. '

S"The Idaho State product could steal the show this week in Detroit. With Jimmy Graham expected to nurse a shoulder injury for the next 2-3 weeks, Hill will be called upon to fill Shaq-sized shoes. In spurts the backup has looked effective. His strong route-running abilities, huge mitts, athleticism and deceptive speed, have occasionally stunned opponents. Targeted only eight times, he's reeled in seven passes for 112 yards and two touchdowns. Ben Watson, a more adept run-blocker, has seen more action (170-to-87 snaps), but clearly the second-year weapon is a better vertical talent. Detroit has defended the pass with uncharacteristic success. The Lions rank top-five in lowest allowed YPA, passing yards and fantasy points to QBs. Major props to Darius Slay and Rashean Mathis. Though they've given up few explosive pass plays, tight ends have chipped away underneath. Larry Donnell (5-56-1), Greg Olsen (6-72-0), Andrew Quarless (4-43-1) and Jace Amaro (5-58-0) each posted useful PPR days against them. Off the bye, Hill steps out of the shadows. "

S"Whether in Fantasyland or zombie-apocalyptic Georgia, sometimes you're the cattle, other times the butcher. This week, Brees would pair nicely with a sesame seed bun. He's averaged a robust 314.8 passing yards per game, but the former All-Pro hasn't found the end zone with his usual regularity. If his 28-TD pace holds, it would be his lowest total since 2007, his second year with the Saints. New Orleans' goal-line efficiency on the ground coupled with Darren Sproles' absence are likely reasons for his profitless return. He's crossed the 20-fantasy-point threshold in every game this season, but, without the services of his best weapon, Jimmy Graham, a marginal week could be in store. Keep in mind 35.8 percent of Brees' TD passes since Week 1 last season have gone to the TE. In the recent past, the Lions were one of the more accommodating pass defenses in the league. Once routinely spanked through the air, Rashean Mathis and Darius Slay have played brilliantly. Combined they've allowed a 64.2 QB rating and 52.1 catch percentage. As a unit, Detroit has yet to give up a multi-TD passer and surrendered only 6.33 yards per attempt. And that was against the likes of Aaron Rodgers, Cam Newton and Eli Manning. On the road, Brees, by the standard he established previously, blows. "

S'When Rashad Jennings suffered a knee sprain two weeks ago, the Williams hype machine went into overdrive. His worked up owners, ecstatic about his increased role, threw out adjectives like "must-start," "stud" and "love muffin" when waxing poetically about the rookie\'s Week 6 value. One humiliating night in Philadelphia later and it\'s time for everyone to reassess. When he gets a full head of steam, the Boston College product is a load of bricks. As his 57.1 yards after contact percentage proves, he\'s a tough dude to bring down. However, he\'s blessed with the elusiveness of a fixed object, struggles in pass protection and is one-sixteenth the receiver of, say, an Alfred Morris. Point blank, he\'s an average power back with limited upside. The Giants offensive line did him no favors in Philly, but on the year he\'s averaged a yack-worthy 3.25 yards per carry. Jennings is likely to miss action for the second straight week, but keep your expectations tempered. Thanks to the stellar execution of defensive tackle Henry Melton and linebacker Justin Durant, the Cowboys have crushed naysayers (Me included) who believed only weeks ago they would be a pushover in all facets defensively. They\'ve given up 5.65 yards per carry to RBs this year, but Arian Foster and Zac Stacy are the only rushers to register top-15 days against them. Unless New York actually employs real Giants to run block, Williams will again be the epitome of mediocrity. '

S"The beginning of the end could already be underway for one of the toughest, most consistent performers to man the RB position this century. According to a recent Ian Rapoport report, the veteran had to earn a roster spot this past summer after the club invested a high draft pick in Carlos Hyde. That tidbit may seem outrageous, especially for a highly productive back who's been the backbone of the Niners organization for the past decade, but based on his dramatic decline over the second half last year, there's truth to it. He looked tremendous against Philly and KC totaling 227 yards and a TD in those efforts, however, he's slowly eroding under the surface. His 46.5 yards after contact percentage is indicative of power lost. More disturbing, in a snug game late in St. Louis, Jim Harbaugh leaned on Hyde to salt away the clock. He could rack a couple more RB2 level games, but his 2014 worth has likely peaked. A difficult road matchup against the Broncos will only solidify that belief. With Von Miller again playing exceptional football, Denver's run D is one of the league's nastiest. RBs are netting just 2.90 yards per carry against it. Rushers have had success in the vertical game against the Broncos, but Gore, with only four receptions on the year, has limitations in that capacity. Seek help elsewhere. "

S'What the heck, Keenan? Without a touchdown and averaging a pedestrian 49.3 receiving yards per game, he\'s slipped into a deep sophomore slump. Including Antonio Gates, he\'s the fourth-most valuable receiver on his team. In per game average, he ranks outside the top-60 among fantasy WRs, behind the likes of Travis Benjamin, Ricardo Lockette and Jarvis Landry. Gag. Because Philip Rivers is one bushy beard and "Manifesto" shy of being Karl Marx, Allen has gotten lost in the socialist shuffle. At least, that\'s what it seems. In truth, Allen\'s presence has increased compared to last year. A season ago, he accounted for 19.1 percent of San Diego\'s targets. This year, that number has grown to 21.1 percent. He\'s seen a slight dip in red-zone looks, but, given his prominent role, he should right the ship soon. However, don\'t expect him to hit the comeback trail this week. KC corner Sean Smith is among the league\'s best in pass coverage. He\'s surrendered a 50.0 catch percentage, 11.5 yards per catch and 76.6 QB rating in five games. Collectively, the Chiefs have allowed only four wideouts to score double-digit fantasy points this year. Brighter days are ahead, but this week, Allen\'s price tag hits a career low. '

S'It won\'t be long before Wayne receives a call from Canton. The six-time Pro Bowl selection ranks top-10 all-time in receptions and receiving yards. Off a shortened 2013 in which he suffered a catastrophic knee injury, he\'s rebounded fairly well. He ranks near the top in targets (54) and has posted an identical line as Houston\'s Andre Johnson (34-419-1). Maybe the former "U" dudes will ride a tandem bike soon too. His subsequent 8.0 fantasy points per game places him barely inside the WR top-36. Because of his high-volume, he\'s still fairly reliable, but matched against a stringent Bengals secondary, lackluster production is in the forecast. Starting corners Terence Newman and Leon Hall have given up just 9.4 yards per catch to their assignments and a 75.8 QB rating. Only Steve Smith, Julio Jones and Kelvin Benjamin have scored 10-plus fantasy points against them. In total, Cincy has conceded the sixth-fewest fantasy points to WRs. Wayne should again entice 7-9 targets, but an outcome similar to last week (9-4-35-0 at Hou) is in the cards. '

S'I\'m sick and tired of Wilson. Yep, I said it. Respect the football player, but his cheesy "Dreams are made" commercials combined with his 10 million other TV spots played ad nauseam this season are beyond annoying. Thankfully, his on-field efforts haven\'t followed suit. The position\'s leading rusher, on pace for a vintage Michael Vick-like 905 yards, has developed into pro football\'s ultimate dual threat. He has more rushing stats than Andre Ellington, Joique Bell and Steven Jackson. Crazy. Presumably due to a lack of weapons, the QB has rarely torched defenses vertically, but his ability to evade would-be tacklers and rack seven-yard gains has maddened defensive coordinators. More of the same is on tap against Philly. Given the delectable matchup, Wilson may fire the rifle more than usual. Quarterbacks are averaging just over 37 attempts per game vs. the Eagles, the sixth-most in the league. Because the Chipster always speeds in work zones and due to Philly\'s shortcomings in pass coverage, particularly Bradley Fletcher whose allowed 17.1 yards per catch, it\'s plausible Wilson tallies his fourth 300-plus total-yard performance of the season while chipping in multiple scores. Teams traveling from coast-to-coast always amplifies concern, but the AmFam pitchman is a firm QB1 in Week 14. Buy a policy. '

S'The rusher, affectionately known as "Boom," has exploded onto the fantasy scene. Appropriate. A luxury sports car compared to the three-wheeled golf cart that is Trent Richardson, the former Buckeye has bulled his way to back-to-back impressive performances, exhibiting long-range speed, interior power and above average hands. Against the Jags and stingy \'Skins he totaled 192 yards, averaging a robust 7.6 yards per carry. His highlight 49-yard TD run was a scamper T-Pain could only dream of. In terms of snap count, Boom continues to play second fiddle, but that could soon change, provided he protects the football. In his past two games, he spilled the pill twice. However, despite the lapses in concentration, he\'s drawn high praise from head coach Chuck Pagano. The Browns, sans Phil Taylor, haven\'t packed much bite defending the run. On the year, they\'ve surrendered 4.30 yards per carry to opposing backs. Two weeks ago another former backup, Alfred Blue, amassed 156 rushing yards against them. On roughly 15-18 touches, Herron could too eclipse the century mark. Keep in mind, the Colts could install a run-heavier game-plan considering how tenaciously DBs Joe Haden and Buster Skrine have defended. Trot out the prized horse with confidence at RB2 in 12-team and deeper leagues. '

S"Since Week 3, the Butter Squirrel hasn't earned his acorns. Sure, he's been sporadically useful, but he's a shell of the player that charged out of the gates, compiling an RB1 line from Weeks 1-3. Since then, he's scraped together a nearly worthless 6.9 per game mark in a PPR setting, ranking him outside the position's top-45. Chip Kelly has stuck to his preseason promise of limiting the rusher. On the year, he's seen an uneventful 21.7 snaps per game. Though his workloads are generally light, this week's matchup plays into his favor. Because of the blanketing nature of Richard Sherman and Earl Thomas, offensive coordinators have regularly attacked Seattle in the short-field. Only Detroit and Jacksonville have given up more receptions to RBs (70) than the 'Hawks. In total, seven rushers have recorded five or more catches against them. Sproles hasn't registered five-plus catches in a game since Week 2, but I suspect he'll be a featured player in the Eagles game plan. He's definitely FLEXY sexy in 12-team PPR formats. "

S"Once believed to be a one-trick pony, the Saints' emerging workhorse has developed into quite the well-rounded force. He's picked up the targets slack for injured Brandin Cooks, becoming more than just a deep threat. Since the rookie's absence in Week 11, Stills has racked 13 receptions (on 15 targets), 260 yards and a touchdown, reeling in most of his catches on numerous sideline outs in the 10-19 yard range. With the Saints back in the Superdome and desperately wanting to wash away the bitter taste of its three-game home skid, he should continue to cash checks this week against the Panthers. The last time Stills faced Carolina, in Week 9, he tallied a commendable five catches for 72 yards, but that was with Cooks in uniform. In the rematch, he should easily top that production. Carolina has allowed the seventh-most fantasy points to WRs on the season. Digging deeper, Panthers starting corner Bene Benwikere has yielded a 65.2 catch rate to his assignments. On tap for another 10-plus targets, the rising wideout lands inside the top-20 among Week 14 WRs. "

S"With Sammy Watkins presumably sipping margaritas somewhere in the Caribbean, Woods has established a strong bond with Kyle Orton. Defenses have clearly keyed on the talented rookie, allowing Woods to take advantage of single coverage, typically against exploitable DBs. As a result, he hauled in 13 receptions (on 19 targets) for 189 yards and a touchdown against the Jets and Browns. Similar to last week's tall task vs. the aforementioned Buster Skrine, Woods draws an uncharitable matchup vs. Denver. On the season, the Broncos have conceded the 10th-fewest fantasy points to WRs. However, possibly down Aqib Talib (hamstring) and with Chris Harris likely to shadow Watkins, Woods could see plenty of Bradley Roby. The rookie hasn't exactly clamped down on his assignments. Targeted 69 times this year, he's given up 45 receptions (65.2 catch percentage) and a 105.5 QB rating. Toss in the likelihood Orton will be pressed to throw some 40-45 times and the pass catcher is a strong candidate to again greatly exceed expectations. Starting him ahead of Martavis Bryant (at Cin), Vincent Jackson (at Det) or a banged up Roddy White (at GB) is a prudent move. "

S"Unfond memories of McCoy's days in Cleveland apparently marred an otherwise commendable quarterback. His tenure in C-town was rather unspectacular. In 24 games, he netted just 182.8 passing yards per game and a near 1:1 TD:INT split. However, in his brief stint with the 'Skins, he's transformed into a legitimate starter, one that might just be Robert Griffin III's permanent replacement. Against the Cowboys and Colts, he completed 72.7 percent of his attempts for 719 yards and three touchdowns. Another top-15 performance is likely in his third turn with Washington. St. Louis' D, which barely penetrated the pocket earlier this season, has rebounded in recent weeks. Since Week 7, Rams pass rushers dragged down QBs 27 times, the second-highest mark over that span. Washington's patchwork offensive line will have its hands full. Last week against Indy, McCoy was put under pressure on 35.8 percent of his dropbacks. Still, when gifted time, the ex-Longhorn should skewer the competition. Passers are averaging 7.5 yards per attempt against the Rams. And don't worry about DeSean Jackson's status. The wide receiver, who suffered a bruised fibula after getting rolled up out-of-bounds last week, is expected to play. Toss in Washington's atrocious secondary, and the overlooked QB has excellent odds of reaching 20-plus fantasy points. "

S"WIth so many upside options to choose from, it's bewildering why Ryan is still being counted on in a majority of leagues. Chucking the rock to Julio Jones and Roddy White and Atlanta's shaky defense are obvious benefits, but the signal-caller is far from reliable. In many ways, he's the Jay Cutler of the South: uneven. His 17.9 points per game output tucks just inside the QB top-12, however, he's tallied only three multi-TD performances in his past eight games. In fact, since Week 5, he's been outpaced by the likes of Kyle Orton, Joe Flacco and Josh McCown. Whoopty friggin' doo. The great outdoors only make matters worse for his Week 14 prospects. Historically, Ryan has struggled terribly in a non-roofed environment.  In his past 22 games away from the Georgie Dome, he's failed to score at least 20 points 54.5 percent of the time. Against a staunch Packers secondary, that number is sure to rise. Because of Green Bay's explosive offense, several opposing QBs have been forced into high-volume situations, which has resulted in handsome numbers at times. Still, the Packers have allowed a mere 6.93 yards per attempt to passers on the year. Even if Green Bay is down corner Sam Shields (concussion) this week, depending on Ryan should be met with trepidation. Colt McCoy (vs. StL) and Ryan Tannehill (vs. Bal) are likely to pack more punch.

S'JC\'s birthday might be right around the corner, but the fantasy babe in a manger will be far from divine in the toughest venue for running backs. Arizona is a place where fantasy points go to die. Stretching back to last year, a span of 14 games, Marshawn Lynch and Joique Bell are the only rushers to accumulate 10 or more fantasy points in the desert. Overall, visiting RBs totaled under 3.5 yards per carry in those contests. Charles is a dynamic, multidimensional weapon who is the centerpiece on a conservative offense. He\'s recorded 12-plus fantasy points in seven consecutive games. But speaking as someone who doesn\'t subscribe to the "Always Start Your Studs" axiom, no player, no matter the talent level or production history, is completely immune from dud weeks. Guess what? They\'re human. With the Cardinals, losers of two straight, desperate to reverse course and considering Alex Smith\'s diffidence toward his wide receivers, Todd Bowles will throw everything and the kitchen sink at Charles. Keep in mind AZ safety Tony Jefferson is one of the better box creepers in the league. '

S"In St. Louis' 52-0 dismemberment of Oakland, the former War Eagle sank his talons into a rancid Raiders defense. His open-field burst, between-the-tackles brawn and overall versatility were clearly on display. His 164 yards and three end zone dives on just 17 touches set the pace among Week 13 rushers and finally ended any doubt he's the Rams' current and future workhorse. Behind an above average offensive line, Mason will be a highly sought after commodity in drafts next year, but this week he's sure to swallow fork-fulls of humble pie. Washington's defensive backfield is a punchline, but it's line is no joke. Within Jim Haslett's base 3-4, linebackers Trent Murphy and Ryan Kerrigan have excelled in gap coverage, each ranking inside the top-25 vs. the run according to Pro Football Focus. Collectively, the Redskins have allowed 3.80 yards per carry and just five ground scores to RBs. Only six rushers in 12 games have totaled at least 10 fantasy points against them. Mason's stock is pointing north, but he isn't a must-start with championship hopes on the line. "

S"New father, first-place team, Andrew Luck's main man  -- it's been quite the year for Hilton. Once allergic to the end zone, he's crossed the chalk frequently in recent weeks, scoring five times in his past seven games. That combined with a 95.4 yards per game mark has the former one-dimensional wideout inside the position's top-12. Indisputably, he's been a profitable thoroughbred at his draft day price point. However, this week, Indy's race horse could pull up lame. His matchup vs. a white-hot Cleveland secondary is rather daunting. Since Week 9, Joe Haden and Buster Skrine have surrendered a combined 43.7 QB rating to their assignments. Over that stretch, only Mike Evans and Julio Jones have tallied 10 fantasy points against them. Because of Cleveland's penetrable defensive line, I suspect Boom Herron will carry the mail early and often, relegating Hilton to a reduced role. To his credit, he's developed into one of the finest receivers in the game, but booking a room elsewhere (e.g. Jarvis Landry (vs. Bal), Kenny Stills (vs. Car) or Brandon LaFell (at SD)) would be a justifiable move.

S"Piece of advice, Jeremy: With smack-talker supreme Richard Sherman coming to town it's strongly encouraged you attach a visor to your helmet. The spit is sure to fly. Sherman has regained his shutdown form after a slow start. Since Week 7, no DB in the league has asphyxiated the opposition quite like him. During that stretch, the boa constrictor has conceded a 43.8 catch rate and, get this, 18.8 QB rating to his assignments. Though he's usually fixed to one side, it would be no surprise if the All-Pro locks horns often with Maclin. Philly's finest all-around weapon has routinely taxed the competition. His 13.7 points per game ranks fourth in Yahoo default scoring. However, since Mark Sanchez replaced Nick Foles under center, celebratory dances by the wide receiver have grown scarce. Largely due to Sanchez's obsession with Jordan Matthews, Maclin has cashed six only once in his past four games. As a result, he's fallen outside the position's top-36 in two of his past three contests. Based on the trend and intimidating matchup, he's more WR3 than WR2 in 12-team leagues. "

S'Based on his recent string of abominable efforts, if Sanchez were a Christmas present, he would be socks and underwear. His three-pick laugher against the Seahawks two weeks ago was predictable. Leading up to that week, Richard Sherman and friends had thrown assignments in fantasy jail. However, last week\'s nauseating performance against a lesser Dallas secondary was puzzling. Blame the tackles inside the five. One wide receiver stretch here or there, and his final output would\'ve ranked top-12. Recall, Chris Polk and Darren Sproles finished the job at close range, totaling three touchdowns. This week, the much maligned passer will rekindle his Sanchize form. I\'m fairly confident Washington would turn any one of Cleveland\'s QB failures, past (e.g. Tim Couch, Brady Quinn) or possibly present, into All-Pros. Corners Bashaud Breeland and David Amerson have struggled mightily, giving up big plays against anyone who has crossed their path. On the year, they\'ve allowed a 68.2 completion percentage and 117.2 QB rating. In total, eight passers have gained "Flame" fame against them since Week 3. Nick Foles chucked 325 yards and three scores in the first matchup. In the encore, Sanchez nearly replicates that level of production. '

S"It can't be emphasized enough. Unless your name is DeMarco Murray or Le'Veon Bell, matchups are the ultimate decider between basking in championship glory or penning a sorrowful fantasy story. Ignore Mason's recent slide. Stuffed by Washington and Arizona, two of the league's nastiest run defenses, the rookie accounted for just 99 yards on 33 carries in Weeks 14-15. Despite the superficial numbers, Mason has performed admirably since overtaking primary duties. A powder keg of sorts, he's packed surprising wallop gaining 52.7 percent of his yards after contact. This week against a doughy Giants defense, he should resemble the back that trounced Oakland to the tune of 164 combined yards and three touchdowns three weeks ago. The G-Men aren't as soft as the Raiders, but they are weaklings in their own right.  Since Week 4, eight rushers have scored double-digits against them. Over that time frame, they've given up 4.92 yards per carry and the sixth-most fantasy points to the position. Because of Shaun Hill's limitations, ball control is typically what Jeff Fisher employs. Given the opponent, Mason is sure to burn a few thousand calories. "

S"Through carbon dating, scientists have confirmed Jackson predates Larry King and the Acasta Gneiss, the oldest rock formation on Earth. At 33, the dude is ancient. Though advanced in age, the rusher's game remains granite solid. Breaking the plane has been rare, but he's averaged a usable 89 total yards per game (On 21.7 touches per contest) over the past three weeks. Clearly, he's the crutch the playoff-angling Bills are leaning on. This week matched with a superb opponent, Oakland, he should crack the RB top-15. The Raiders have allowed the second most fantasy points to rushers, yielding at least one touchdown to the position in 12 of 14 games. In total, a dozen RBs have scored at least 11 fantasy points against them. Buffalo ranks third-to-last in run-blocking according to Pro Football Focus, but against a feeble foe, Jackson should fill your cup with cheer.  And don't worry about C.J. Spiller's likely return. Given his extended layoff, it's hard to imagine he'll be grip the pigskin more than 8-10 times. "

S'When it was announced Sunday morning Julio Jones would not suit up against Pittsburgh, Douglas was added in droves in the eleventh hour. He didn\'t disappoint, enticing 14 targets, catching 10 of them for 131 yards. PPR gold. Julio\'s status for Week 16 remains uncertain. Head coach Mike Smith believes his prized wideout will return to action, citing Monday the receiver\'s hip had "improved." Still, until he logs a practice or two, there\'s no guarantee Jones will be on the field for Sunday\'s critical NFC South slug-fest. With or without No. 11, Douglas offers plenty of upside as a WR3. The last time he faced the Saints, with a healthy Julio in Week 1, he posted a useful 6-69-0 line. Because of Jones\', and to a certain extent Roddy White\'s, presumed physical limitations, Atlanta\'s best kept "Secret" should emerge from Week 16 with flowery numbers. New Orleans, despite a standout effort against a cooked Bears team, continues to have issues defensively. To bolster a secondary that\'s struggled mightily this year, Sean Payton recently demoted corner Corey White. However, Keenan Lewis (101.5 QB rating allowed) and White\'s replacement, Terrence Frederick (105.0), remain beatable. Overall, the Saints have given up the eighth-most fantasy points to WRs. Matchup and personnel concerns suggest Douglas tucks inside the WR top-30.  '

S'Last week, several fantasy "experts" (Sidebar: For the record, I despise the term "expert" for fantasy guys. Obviously, we don\'t know everything. "Fanalyst" is far more appropriate.) waxed romantically about Moncrief\'s expected Week 15 explosion. His matchup against a routinely toasted Houston defense stoked egos and fueled false confidence. A top-24 output seemed inevitable. Sadly, the greatly admired receiver didn\'t deliver. The rookie did see action on 52.2 percent of Indy snaps, but attracting a mere three targets and didn\'t register a single catch. For many, the sprinkles on that donut tasted bitter, to say the least. This week, bank on a rebound. Moncrief poses a matchup problem for Dallas. His lethal mixture of size, speed and physicality should thwart a vulnerable \'Boys pass defense. Targeted 56 times since Week 10, Orlando Scandrick and Brandon Carr have yielded 40 receptions. That\'s a 71.4 catch rate folks. Worse for Carr, he\'s conceded 20.6 yards per catch during that stretch. And, no, that\'s not a typo. Yes, T.Y. Hilton is Andrew Luck\'s top taco and Reggie Wayne, shockingly, is still kicking, but Moncrief currently wears a post-hype label. '

S"To put it mildly, when the ball is in Asiata's hands, he resembles an overweight flightless bird. He's sluggish, clunky and generally inept, a true-to-form complementary back. To be fair, he's an excellent receiver and blocker, which explains why he's seen over 50 percent of in-game snaps since Week 12, but averaging a ghastly 3.22 yards per carry on the season he's the antithesis of special. Though painfully unexciting, I sincerely believe he could be a difference-maker in fantasy Super Bowls. His Week 16 opponent, Miami, has unraveled of late defensively, particularly defending the run. Joe Philbin recently blamed the D-line's slump on poor fundamentals -- tackling and gap coverage. Injuries at the linebacker position have also played a part as Koa Misi and Jelanki Jenkins have battled through setbacks. Over the Dolphins' past five contests, they've surrendered 4.88 yards per carry and the 10th-most fantasy points to the RB position. A bloodhound near the goal-line, Asiata could ram his way into the end zone for a score or two. Debate his merits at the FLEX in PPR leagues. "

S"Familiar bed, smiling faces, untainted pregame meals \xe2\x80\x93 home is usually where the heart is for Big Ben. In six games at the Mustard Bottle, he's averaged a gaudy 8.9 yards per attempt, 373.3 passing yards per game and tallied a 20:3 TD:INT split. Bombs away. However, including last week's underwhelming effort in Atlanta (360-0-0), Ben has been wildly erratic in recent weeks. In three of his past five contests, he's failed to register multiple touchdowns. Unfortunately, for those with trophy hopes on the line, his mediocrity could continue. Kansas City is a formidable pass defense. The Chiefs have rarely forced interceptions, but they've yielded only 6.17 yards per attempt, 213.9 passing yards per game and 1.5 passing touchdowns per game, equal to the second-fewest fantasy points allowed to the position. In fact, no signal-caller has surpassed 270 yards against them in a game this season. Jake Locker, Peyton Manning and Russell Wilson are the only passers to rack 20-plus fantasy points vs. K.C. Chris Harris, Darrelle Revis and Richard Sherman, justifiably, have garnered accolades for their handiwork, but corner Sean Smith has been every bit as good. According to Pro Football Focus, he ranks as the fourth-best cover corner in the league. Because the Chiefs limit explosive pass plays and are vulnerable against the run (5.03 yards per carry allowed to RBs), Week 16 sets up for loads of Le'Veon Bell. Todd Haley will remain air aggressive, but the matchup arrows to conservative final numbers for No. 7.  "

S"Engaging in hand-to-hand combat with Liam Neeson. That sounds more appealing than trotting McCoy out against a stingy Redskins run defense on the road. Chip Kelly is threatening to supplant Bill Belichick atop the list of Fantasyland's most evil coaches. Last week's game against the Cowboys clearly exhibited his remarkable treachery. Only once at close range did the running back, a rusher who's previously been effective inside the five, earned a carry. Instead, Chris Polk and Darren Sproles basked in scoring glory, causing McCoy owners to take out their frustrations on innocent holiday decorations from coast-to-coast. Poor Elf on a Shelf. This week, it could be tough sledding for McCoy across the board. The only positive from this year's Redskins is their ability to defend the run. Washington has conceded just 3.69 yards per carry and the third-fewest fantasy points to the position. In the team's last nine games, only three rushers have grossed 10-plus fantasy points against them. McCoy likely won't alter the trend. The last time he faced the divisional foe, he amassed a disgusting 22 yards on 20 carries. Appropriately, the Eagle, who's failed miserably to live up to his top-pick billing, finishes the year on a sour note. "

S'Among this year\'s group of Paddington Bears, Forte might be the only player on offense still giving 110 percent. Mentally, the team, much like its lame duck coach, is sipping umbrella drinks on the shores of Cozumel, completely disengaged. Behind an offensive line that surrendered seven sacks to the Saints last Monday, Jay Cutler is simply hoping his massive ego won\'t be permanently damaged in either of his last two games. Forte, per usual, should grip the rock some 18-20 times, but given the disheveled state of the organization, trepidation is warranted. The opponent doesn\'t inspire confidence either. In terms of containing running backs, the Lions are definitely kings of the fantasy jungle. Including Forte\'s "earth-shattering" Turkey Day performance (11-58-0), only three RBs have earned their "Flames" membership against them since Week 6. On the year, rushers are netting an abysmal 3.09 yards per carry vs. Detroit. In a brutal matchup week for marquee backs, Forte is sure to post bearish numbers. (UPDATE: And now Cutler has been benched for Jimmy Clausen according to Adam Schefter. Forte may see an uptick in receptions, but it could get Medusa-ugly in Chicago Sunday.) '

S'Press Your Luck with Murray and you might just land on a Whammy. The Week 16 picture for the running back is grim. Though the broken hand he suffered, his off-hand, has been surgically repaired, the rusher remains physically limited. Sure he can still plow through defensive lines, but his contributions in the pass game whether as a blocker or receiver are severely handicapped, stunting his overall value. The likelihood defenders will attack his injured hand also raises concern. According to Jerry Jones, the NFL\'s rushing leader is a full-blown game-time decision. Murray did practice Wednesday, but even if he goes, it\'s unlikely he\'ll receive his usual 20-25 touches. Surely, Joseph Randle, and especially Lance Dunbar, will work into the mix, possibly reducing Murray\'s load to around 14-16 carries. It\'s complicated. Indy is a favorable opponent. On the season, the Colts have allowed 4.22 yards per carry and the seventh most fantasy points to RBs. At least one plowshare has scored 12 fantasy points against them in PPR leagues three straight weeks. "Start your studs" zealots will scream, if Murray is active, you\'re playing him. However, given the unique circumstances and subsequent reservations, debating alternatives such as Tre Mason (vs. NYG), Fred Jackson (at Oak) or Jonathan Stewart (vs. Cle) is strongly recommended. Player loyalty doesn\'t necessarily equate to fantasy championships. Be smart. (If active).'

S"What the hell happened to Peyton Manning?! Did aliens abduct his passing skills and replace them with J.P. Losman's? Looking terribly human the past three weeks, the future Hall of Famer has crestfallen supporters. Hampered by flu-like symptoms, a bad thigh and plain old ineptitude, he's averaged a loathsome 195 passing yards per game and tallied a 3:2 TD:INT split in his last three games. Denver's dedication to C.J. Anderson and physical setbacks are mostly responsible for the downturn, but Manning's uncharacteristic string of duds is unnerving. As a result, Sanders' numbers, unsurprisingly, have suffered. A top-three wideout from Weeks 1-12, he's compiled the 44th-best line over the last three weeks, netting a meek 60.7 yards per game. Another bland effort is likely on tap. Cincinnati's strength defensively resides in its secondary. Leon Hall has occasionally struggled over the regular season's second half, but Terrance Newman and Adam Jones have continued to pester assignments. Combined, the pair have allowed under 11 yards per catch and a 76.4 QB rating since Week 9. Only six wide receivers have registered 60 or more yards against the Bengals this year. Because of Cincy's ongoing problems stopping the run, another heavy dose of Anderson is likely. "

S"Are you afraid of football-tossing redheads? Don't be a Gingerphobe. Last week playing a Ravens team he notoriously struggled against, Dalton stiff armed history, worked almost exclusively out of the 'gun, was rarely under heat (10.0 pressure percentage per Pro Football Focus) and completed 25-of-38 passes for 301 yards and a touchdown. The commendable effort marked the sixth time in his past 13 starts he crossed the 300-yard line. He could easily add to that total in Week 2. Outside Desmond Trufant, the Falcons secondary doesn't exactly strike fear into the heart of opponents. Yes it was Drew Brees and New Orleans, but Cool-lanta surrendered 333 yards and 7.9 yards per attempt to the future Hall of Famer. Prior to the opener, owners were worried about Hue Jackson's desire to implement a run heavier scheme. However, after the Bengals chucked it nearly 60 percent of the time vs. Baltimore, concerns may have been premature. Given the favorable matchup, Dalton should resemble the passer that finished top-five a season ago. Look for him to connect with A.J. Green on a bomb or three. "

S"Greene's reputation in fantasy is akin to the Golden Corral's in the culinary world ... unexceptional. His numerous three-yard plods, subsequent bland YPC, one-dimensional skill set and sporadic usefulness have uninspired the masses. Though he sat atop the RB depth-chart for the entire summer, it was no fluke he fell into the double-digit rounds of 12-team drafts. However, don't underestimate his Week 2 scoring potential. On the road in KC last Sunday, Greene actually played well. On 15 carries, he rolled up 71 yards (4.7 yards per carry) gaining 67.7 percent of his production after first contact. He also led the charge in Ken Whisenhunt's split backfield logging a team-high 33 snaps (Dexter McCluster played 20, Leon Washington 18, Bishop Sankey 11). Matched against a Dallas front that lived down to its bottom-barrel expectations giving up 4.52 yards per carry to San Fran backs last week, Greene should find creases to exploit. A fixture in short-yardage and at the goal-line, he has a strong chance of scoring, especially if Jake Locker continues to excel. For one week only, Greene will be the color of money. "

S'Instead of weights or miles on the treadmill, Knowshon crushed tacos, lots and lots of tacos, this offseason. He reportedly packed on some 25-30 pounds prior to June mini-camp, added beef that likely contributed to the knee scope he underwent in early July. But no longer doughy, the leaner rusher is back in business and threatening to permanently overtake Lamar Miller on the depth-chart. Last week against a rock solid New England defense, he looked like the chain-mover that recorded top-five numbers last season in Denver. Behind a surprisingly effective Miami offensive line, he was tough between the tackles racking up 134 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries (5.6 ypc). Despite the stellar performance, Bill Lazor maintains the veteran and Miller are locked in an undetermined rotation. Game flow may dictate who will get touches and when, but it seems clear Moreno is entrenched as the early down and goal-line back with his wing man working primary on pass downs. This week in Buffalo, look for more of the same. The Bills conceded 4.8 yards per carry to Matt Forte in Week 1. If the Miami uglies can generate considerable push in the trenches, another 100 yards could be on tap for Moreno. '

S'A Haley\'s Comet sighting, a fantasy "expert" landing a date, Nicks finding the end-zone -- these are some of life\'s biggest rarities. After failing to cross the chalk once last season and finishing outside the position\'s top-70 in per game average, most owners moved on. Limited by a myriad of injuries the past two years in New York, Nicks looked wooden and uninterested, a shell of the once unstoppable downfield threat. But the change of scenery may have done the still only 26-year-old some good. Utilized almost exclusively on shallow crosses and quick outs Week 1 in Denver, he looked fluid, bouncy and confident. He caught all five of Andrew Luck\'s intended targets, totaling 36 yards and, of all things, a touchdown, his first score since Week 14 of 2012. Improbably, he could hit pay-dirt in consecutive weeks. The Eagles, unpredictably, were blasted by Chad Henne and Allen Hurns in their opener. Corner Cary Williams was especially awful, surrendering 29.3 yards per catch to his assignments. Nicks will continue to work underneath, but given his renewed vigor, generous matchup (Vegas over/under opened at 52.5) and primo red-zone role, he\'s worth slotting in at WR3. The comeback tour is well underway. '

S'The diminutive receiver is reminiscent of Yen from "Ocean\'s 11." He\'s pocket-sized, incredibly elusive and can fit through the tightest spaces, a legit "greaseman." Last week in a shootout with the Steelers, the dirty worker lived up to the billing, grabbing eight passes (on nine targets) for 87 yards, many of those catches coming in the short-field. PPR gold. A similar effort against visiting New Orleans is in the offing. The Saints, like most teams, were terrible in coverage last week vs. Atlanta. Corners Patrick Robinson, Keenan Lewis and Corey White, who played mostly man, surrendered a combined 16 catches on 19 targets. Obviously, Hawkins isn\'t the caliber of a Julio Jones or Roddy White and Brian Hoyer is roughly a billion steps down from Matt Ryan, but the Saints\' secondary isn\'t intimidating. And Jordan Cameron\'s possible unavailability could lead to a major uptick in targets. Equally important, if Cleveland\'s D, which allowed over seven yards per play to Pittsburgh last Sunday, again rolls over, a high-scoring affair should materialize, increasing fantasy scoring opportunities for Baby Hawk. Throw the Brown a bone as a WR3 in 12-teamers. '

S"Sanu, hiding in the weeds throughout August, attracted few suitors in drafts. With the expectation Dalton would cut some 150 pass attempts off last year, the overlooked target was viewed as nothing more than waiver fodder, even with Marvin Jones slated to miss at least the first five weeks of the regular season. The third-year weapon didn't light up the virtual scoreboard Week 1 vs. Baltimore. On five targets, Sanu grabbed four passes for 36 yards and chipped in a two-point conversion. Most encouragingly, however, he didn't drop a single pass. Still, his Week 2 matchup against Atlanta possesses video game-like appeal that could net him ample targets. Last week against New Orleans, Trufant and Robert Alford were often humiliated downfield by Marques Colston and Brandin Cooks. The duo combined for 12 catches, 187 yards and a touchdown. With Green drawing so much attention, Sanu, who is no munchkin at 6-foot-2, 210-pounds, stands to benefit from single coverage. Tyler Eifert's loss, too, should ramp up his role. FLEX him with confidence in deeper leagues. "

S"If Vegas set an over/under for Cutler smirks on Sunday night, it would likely be well into the double-digits. His Smugness performed well statistically in the opener tallying 349 yards and two touchdowns, but committed two turnovers and slowed down considerably when Alshon Jeffery and Brandon Marshall exited with injuries. Understandable. Marc Trestman's offense will certainly keep him in the QB1 conversation long-term, however, his mistake proneness, especially when placed under pressure, will limit him at times. This week is no exception. Despite being down a number of key players on defense (e.g. Aldon Smith), the Niners forced numerous Tony Romo meltdowns, picking and sacking the quarterback three times each. Jeffery and Marshall, both dealing with lower body injuries, are expected to be in uniform and the Chicago O-line only placed its passer under pressure 19.6 percent of the time vs. Buffalo, but if Patrick Willis and Co. dial up the heat, Cutler will fold. Combine that with San Fran's strong likelihood of running the ball down the Bears' throat and controlling the clock, and it could be a forgettable night for the QB. Jay may need a cartoon of Marlboro's after this one. "

S"Stacy owners, who likely invested a Round 2 pick in the sophomore rusher in August drafts, had their worst nightmares realized Week 1 in a blowout loss to Minnesota. Yes, game flow was an influential factor, but the stocky back played two fewer snaps than Benny Cunningham (31-to-33), a scenario Rams GM Les Snead remarked two weeks ago could materialize this season. Both backs totaled 51 yards with Stacy out-gaining the complement 43-to-21 on the ground. Because Cunningham is more explosive on the edge and a superior receiver, a 60-40 or possibly 50-50 split could be the norm, a frightening prospect for those counting on Stacy as a RB2 or, insanely, RB1. Tampa underwhelmed defensively Week 1 vs. division rival Carolina, making Derek Anderson channel Steve Beuerlein circa '99. However, the Bucs were rather immovable in the trenches giving up a mere 3.43 yards per carry. Linebacker Lavonte David, who racked 11 tackles, was particularly impressive stuffing the run. With Austin Davis possibly under center, the tough road environment and Cunningham's considerable role, Stacy is completely avoidable even in 12-team leagues this week. Flat Stanley has better odds of finishing inside the RB top-20. "

S"The proposed two-back rotation in Detroit evolved the way most anticipated Week 1. In Detroit's suplexing of the Giants on Monday night, Bush and tag-team partner Joique Bell played an almost identical number of snaps (35-to-31 Bell), with the latter option netting just one more touch (16-to-15). As will be the case most of the year, Reggie will make his fantasy hay almost exclusively in the pass game. His tender hands, elusiveness in space and open-field burst are maximized in such a role. If, and that's a gigantic IF, he can suit up 16 times this season, he's a strong candidate for 65-70 receptions, though touchdowns will be few and far between. He's still viable in PPR leagues this week, but don't expect a spectacular return. The Panthers were exceptional in short-field defense last year, collapsing and clamping down on backs in the flat. Jason Snelling was the only rusher to score a receiving touchdown against Luke Kuechly and company. Suffocating vs. Tampa last week, Carolina should contain Bush. "

S"Missed opportunities summed up Allen's opening week effort in Arizona. Pinched by Patrick Peterson and Antonio Cromartie, he caught only five of nine intended targets for 37 yards. His unfortunate drop on a tipped pass on San Diego's last offensive play was symbolic. Better days lay ahead for the second-year receiver, but he's hard to employ as even a WR3 in 12-teamers this week against visiting Seattle. Richard Sherman committed to one side last Thursday vs. Green Bay, a move that allowed OC Tom Clements to shift Jordy Nelson around to avoid an encounter with the All-Pro. As a result, Jordy enticed 14 targets catching nine passes for 83 yards. Allen could see a similar workload, but Byron Maxwell is no pushover in coverage. He did surrender a catch percentage of 81.8 Week 1, but held his assignments to a lowly 8.8 yards per reception. Allen could very well chip in respectable PPR numbers, but another uneventful performance is on the docket. Buy low after this week. "

S"Goose poop. That's essentially what Cruz, and really the entire New York passing offense, resembled Monday in Detroit. Against what many perceived to be an exploitable Lions secondary, the former Pro Bowler hauled in only two passes for 24 yards, dropping a couple additional opportunities. The constant heat Eli Manning experienced (31.4 pressure percentage) was partially to blame, but Cruz's occasionally lapses in concentration and overall awfulness explained the sorrowful output. The newly installed system under Ben McAdoo is clearly a work in progress. It should improve as the season wears on, but the wideout is a potentially toxic option this week against visiting Arizona. As noted above, Peterson and Cromartie were outstanding against San Diego last Monday. Jerraud Powers was no slouch either. Combined the three corners conceded a 37.5 catch rate. Asphyxiating. Cruz is already demanding more targets and will probably get them, but it's doubtful he graduates from the WR3 class this week. "

S"To the delight of no one, RG3 has offered little to the fantasy community this season. His ankle dislocation Week 2 and subsequent prolonged recovery led many to seek alternatives. As a result, his ownership dipped dramatically, bottoming out around 30 percent in Yahoo leagues a few weeks back. Reacquired in several leagues, RG3 remains the subject of uncertainty for skittish owners. Prior to the Redskins' bye, the signal-caller performed laudably in his first game back. Against a better-than-advertised Vikings secondary he completed 64.3 percent of his attempts for 251 yards and a touchdown, airing it out to the tune of 9.0 yards per attempt. It's clear, based on his unaffecting rush stats (7-24-0), Jay Gruden would like to keep him tied to the pocket. However, RG3 will continue to take advantage of what the defense gives him, occasionally sprinting into the open field. His rushing skills will likely be quelled this week, but because of Tampa's ineptitude defending the pass, his arm will unload. QBs are averaging 7.91 yards per attempt against the Bucs. In total, six have racked at least 20 fantasy points against them. Alterraun Verner, who is arguably one of the biggest free agent busts this year, has allowed a 127.5 QB rating. Shaking off the last of the rust over the bye, RG3 unloads on the Bucs."

S'Not long ago, Mathews and I were an inseparable item. He was the Daryl Hall to my John Oates. But after numerous injuries and fantasy failures, last year, "I Can\'t Go For That" became my theme song on draft day. Naturally, Mathews returned to his 2011 form. Used only sparingly over the regular season\'s first half in 2013, the former Pro Bowler was unleashed by Mike McCoy down the homestretch. From Week 10 on, the bulldozer churned out an RB1 line (4.6 ypc, 112.3 total yards per game, 5 TDs), finishing No. 6 in per game average among rushers. Though he hasn\'t logged a snap since Week 2 due to a sprained knee, the veteran could be deployed similarly the rest of the season. His legs are fresh and with the Chargers ground attack sputtering over their past couple games, he\'s sure to supplant Branden Oliver as the power back, pushing the rookie to fill the Danny Woodhead role. Mathews told Chargers beat writer Eric Williams Sunday he "feels good, feels fast." San Diego\'s offensive line is a bit rickety and he could net just 12-15 carries in his return, but based on the ultra-friendly matchup \xe2\x80\x93 Oakland has allowed the third-most fantasy points to RBs \xe2\x80\x93 he could could storm back with a vengeance. Debate his merits as a RB2 in 12-team and deeper leagues.'

S'Vereen is essentially a broken clock. He\'s the right call about two times per year. This week in Indy is one of those opportunities. The Colts rank in the middle of the pack in fantasy points allowed to RBs, surrendering 4.29 yards per carry. However, as Darren Sproles, Justin Forsett, Le\'Veon Bell and, of all people, Peyton Hillis proved, they\'re a vulnerable defense vertically in the short-field. Each of those backs collected at least five receptions and 50 yards against them. Because of Beelzichick\'s sinister ways, Vereen hasn\'t become the workhorse some projected post-Stevan Ridley injury. Since Week 7, he\'s played on roughly 65 percent of New England\'s snaps netting 13.3 touches per game. Still, with Jonas Gray locked into the "big back" role, the Pats\' "joker" should laugh all the way to the bank. In a game with considerable shootout potential (57.5 Over/Under in Vegas), he cracks the RB top-15.  '

S"The geriatric receiver may have been born in the Jurassic, but a fantasy T-Rex in recent weeks, he's consistently devoured the competition. Since Week 6, he's spit out a top-15 output, totaling 6.5 receptions and 83 yards per game along with three touchdowns. Accuracy issues have plagued Colin Kaepernick, but the dolphin smooth veteran continues to get it done. This week another standout performance is likely. In its first game without Prince Amukamara, the Giants secondary was minimally challenged. Marshawn Lynch and Russell Wilson gashed New York's defense almost exclusively on the ground. A banged-up Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and Zach Bowman were thrown at only seven times. Because the Niners' ground attack has been average at best, it's entirely conceivable Greg Roman bombards the Giants. Boldin, who's grabbed at least six passes in four straight games, extends his PPR-friendly streak. "

S'If you would\'ve told me back in August the Browns would be atop the AFC North with a 6-3 record, I would\'ve instantly thought Cameron was an indispensable part of the offense. However, limited greatly by ongoing concussion issues and a nagging shoulder injury, he\'s contributed about as much to fantasy as backup-turned-starter Chad Ford. Whoopty flippin\' woo. In six contests, Cameron has averaged a pedestrian 5.2 fantasy points per game in standard settings, the 21st-best output among tight ends. Despite the uninspiring play, he\'s worth plugging back in this week vs. Houston. He remains week-to-week, but indications arrow to him suiting up Sunday. Plus-sized targets have inflicted only minor damage against the Texans this year. Niles Paul (Week 1) and Delanie Walker (Week 8) are the only TEs to exceed 10 fantasy points against them following the "Flames" scoring system. Still, they are vulnerable across the middle. Linebackers Mike Mohamed and Brian Cushing, thrown at 35 times, have yielded 30 receptions. Houston\'s safeties, particularly Kendrick Lewis (103.2 QB rating allowed), also aren\'t the stingiest. Working under the assumption he\'ll be cleared for takeoff, Cameron should regain owner confidence in short order.'

S"In this day and age of fan impatience for rookie QBs being immediately thrown into the mix is very much a sink or swim proposition. Carr has made mistakes, but, for the most part, he's tread water, completing 61.1 percent of his attempts. He's missed the mark too often downfield, but the youngster has excelled on play-action. Despite being placed under pressure 33.9 percent of the time, his 6.9 sack rate is also the best in the league. The kid does possess excellent pocket awareness. In fantasy terms, Carr has surpassed 20 fantasy points in a game just three times in nine starts. Still, the matchup this week is awfully enticing, especially for Tony Romo owners desperate for options. San Diego, down Jason Verrett, remains thin at corner. Though Brandon Flowers, the fourth-best DB in coverage per Pro Football Focus, has often clamped down, his colleagues aren't as unforgiving. Shareece Wright, for example, has yielded a QB rating of 90-plus in two of his past three starts. Overall, San Diego has allowed a 17:4 TD:INT split in nine games. Carr spanked the Chargers for 282 yards and four scores back in Week 6. And that was with Verrett on the field. Don't expect similar spectacular results in the rematch, but a useful tally should be scored."

S"Outside Steelers facilities an angry mob comprised of disgruntled Big Ben owners has formed. With pitchforks and torches in hand, they're seeking some sort of restitution. His final Week 10 line (343-1-2) didn't exactly torpedo virtual franchises, but when put into context -- 12 TDs the past two games ... the matchup -- his uneventful contribution warranted outcries. This was the Jets after all. A blindfolded Ryan Leaf could've connected on at least three touchdowns against them. Under-performance aside, Roethlisberger has become a bit split-brained. At home, he's rewritten NFL record books notching a near perfect 18:1 TD:INT disparity while averaging 361.2 passing yards per game in five contests. However, away, he's performed marginally, evidenced in his 251.4 yards per game and 5:4 TD:INT output in five clashes. This week in Tennessee, that trend will hold true. Last week, the Titans flexed their defensive muscle against Joe Flacco. Coty Sensabaugh's return helped his club contain the Ravens signal-caller to just 169 yards and a score. Blidi Wreh-Wilson was a pushover, but Sensabaugh and Jason McCourty surrendered a combined 78.1 QB rating. On the season, the Titans rank No. 6 in fewest fantasy points allowed to QBs. Only Andrew Luck and Brian Hoyer have tossed multiple TDs against them. Given Ben's struggles on the road and Tennessee's problems defending the run, a whole lotta Le'Veon Bell should be expected. "

S"Overloaded boxes are in Ellington's immediate future. Sans Carson Palmer, Ndamukong Suh and cohorts will surely dare Drew Stanton to beat them over-the-top, stacking the line in an attempt to stamp out the run. Ellington, who's carried a hard hat and lunch pail netting 26 touches per game since Week 6, will again throw a boulder on his back. Without Palmer, he will be the centerpiece of Bruce Arians' game plan. Unfortunately, due to his unsightly 3.11 yards per carry mark over his past six game and the difficult matchup (Detroit has allowed only 3.20 yards per carry to RBs this year), a Matt Asiata-like 20 carries for minimal yardage is distinctly possible. For the PPR masses, the good news here is Detroit's ongoing ineffectiveness bottling up backs in the flat. Fred Jackson, Jerick McKinnon and Travaris Cadet each grabbed six or more passes vs. Detroit. Ellington, a phenomenal pass catcher, is sure to compile a useful yield in such a format. However, for standard leaguers, he may need 40 touches to crack the position's top-15. "

S'Among top picks who have been on the field, is there a bigger bust than McCoy? Harder to stomach than chugging a gallon of carbonated liquid Doritos (Yes, it\'s a real thing), he\'s averaged just 11.9 points per game in the "Flames" arena, ranking No. 23 in the category among all RBs. Money not so well spent. Against a highly exploitable Panthers front, his 17 total yards and a touchdown last Monday was most discouraging. Blame the offensive line \xe2\x80\x93 the Eagles trotted out their sixth different combination vs. Carolina \xe2\x80\x93 all you want, but McCoy continues to press. Instead of taking the short gain, he\'s looked to hit a home run, racking up negative gains in the process. On the year, 39.9 percent of his rushes have gone for 1-yard or less. Maybe that\'s why Chip Kelly awarded Darren Sproles a goal-line touch Monday. His minimal impact in the pass game is also unnerving. Green Bay, squishy up front most of the early season, has stiffened in recent weeks. Over their past three games, the Packers have surrendered just the sixth-fewest fantasy points to RBs. Shady blasted the Packers in Lambeau last year, plowing his way to 155 yards on 25 carries. However, this time around he\'ll leave owners out in the cold. '

S'Watkins, one the most hyped rookie wide receiver in this year\'s class, has, for the most part, lived up to his promise. Flourishing with Hogwarts wizard-in-training, Kyle Orton, under center, he\'s on pace (74-1096-9) to finish inside the top-10 all-time among first-year wideouts in total fantasy points. Based on his reliable contributions \xe2\x80\x93 he\'s scored at least 13 fantasy points in four of his past six contests \xe2\x80\x93 the youngster is usually someone to lean on. However, a nettlesome groin injury combined with an unfriendly matchup, don\'t lend much confidence. Thursday Night Football, a persistent curse for owners, also doesn\'t help. Miami is the most underappreciated defense in professional football. Strong up front and strangling on the back end, the Dolphins rank No. 4 in total D. Peeling back the layers of the onion, Brent Grimes, whose stupendous one-handed pick of Matthew Stafford last week was the highlight grab of the year, is one of the league\'s nastiest corners. Virtually "shutdown," he\'s surrendered only a 60.4 QB rating this year. Overall, Miami has allowed the sixth-fewest fantasy points to WRs. Watkins spanked the Fighting Flippers to the tune of 8-117-1 Week 2. The second time around, though, a different story will likely be written. '

S'It\'s been a rather tumultuous year in the Windy City. Blanketed by a constant layer of gray, Chicago, much like Marshall\'s fantasy value, has greatly underwhelmed. See last week\'s beat down in Green Bay. After calling out Jay Cutler a couple weeks ago, the squeaky wheel finally got the grease in last Sunday\'s disembowelment. His 8-112-1 output was his best effort since Week 2 and only his second double-digit fantasy performance in his last seven. Given the schizophrenic state of the team, it\'s hard to project what Bears offense will show. However, battling through yet another ankle injury and matched against an underrated Vikings secondary, Marshall could reveal his sinister fantasy side. Vikes corner Captain Munnerlyn hasn\'t exactly dazzled (110.5 QB rating allowed), but compatriot Xavier Rhodes occasionally has, conceding a 54.2 catch percentage. Overall, Minnesota has given up the 11th-fewest fantasy points to wide receivers. Marshall vows he\'ll be "ready to roll" for Week 11, but with the Bears already hibernating for winter, one has to wonder if his production will also fall asleep. '

S"If you were to poll 100 random people on the street about the greatest hip-hop artists ever, Snoop, Dre, Biggie, Tupac, Jay-Z and Eminem would undoubtedly receive multiple votes. However, Slick Rick, the orchestrator of lyrical masterpiece 'Children's Story,' deserves a mention. Rivers, in a strange and twisted way, is like the esteemed storyteller. In fantasy circles, he's never discussed among the game's elites, but in terms of contributions, he's highly, highly productive, an underrated asset who should garner more acclaim. Off the sixth-best campaign among QBs last year, Rivers has bested that rank through three weeks (No. 5), a stunning achievement considering his tough early season schedule (at Ari, Sea, at Buf). Thus far he's completed 68.4 percent of his attempts, averaged 259.3 passing yards per game and compiled a 6:1 TD:INT split. And he's accomplished that with Keenan Allen presumably in witness protection. Jacksonville is back in all too familiar territory. Outscored 99-to-44 through three games, the Jags have been routinely dissected by the opposition. Nick Foles, Kirk Cousins and Andrew Luck each achieved 'Flame' status against them. Overall, they've surrendered 8.64 yards per attempt, 333.3 passing yards per game and eight total passing touchdowns. No surprise, starting CBs Dwayne Gratz and Allan Ball rank outside the top-70 in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus. La di da di, the Bolo Tie is about to party. "

S"Admittedly, my obsession for Miller is rather disturbing. Seduced by his open-field wheels, versatility and elusiveness, I stupidly shelled out $45 for his services in a $200 PPR auction last summer. Not deterred by his deflating 2013, I went back to the well, albeit at a much cheaper price, in August and grabbed him for $21. Love is blind. Though overshadowed by Knile Davis in Week 3, Miller met my lofty expectations in an expanded role versus Kansas City. He exploded through holes, evaded tacklers and made numerous plays in the pass game. In total, he racked 132 yards on 19 touches, averaging an obscene 7.2 yards per carry. He's found the end zone only once in three games, but his 0.25 fantasy points per snap is nothing to scoff at. With Knowshon Moreno out again and the first slate of bye weeks kicking in, Miller is a recommended RB2 play at Oakland. The Raiders were surprisingly effective versus Stevan Ridley and Shane Vereen in Week 3. Rookie Khalil Mack, who currently ranks No. 1 among all linebackers versus the run according to Pro Football Focus, was an untamed beast, accounting for six tackles and four stops. His star is only ascending, but the rest of the Raiders are average at best. On the year Oakland has conceded 4.54 yards per carry and the sixth most fantasy points to RBs. On another 15-20 touches, bank on Miller to earn his Shillings across the pond. (In London)"

S"A carbon copy of former Saint and current Jet Chris Ivory, Robinson is a battering ram with no regard for personal health. He runs violently north and south breaking through arm tackles with regularity. So far 69 of his 128 yards have come after initial contact. He's forced just two missed tackles on 32 carries, but it's his interior brawn that makes him useful, especially this week. Shockingly, the Cowboys, thought to have the worst defense in franchise history entering the year, are nowhere near as bad as advertised. Granted they haven't faced the stiffest tests \xe2\x80\x93 Tennessee and St. Louis were relatively easy assignments \xe2\x80\x93 but they've yet to surrender a 70-yard rusher and have allowed just one touchdown through three weeks. Despite the encouraging efforts, they remain vulnerable. Dallas has given up 4.75 yards per carry to opposing RBs. Last week, Pierre Thomas, and not Khiry, converted a goal-line tote for a touchdown against Minnesota. However, in a contest which Drew Brees should find success attacking downfield, I suspect Robinson will get an opportunity or two to punch one in. "

S"Many tabbed Wheaton, hanging in the shadows of most drafts, a deep-round sleeper just a few weeks ago. Pittsburgh's projected dreadful defense, no-huddle offense and Antonio Brown's safety-drawing presence was sure to benefit the sophomore receiver. Though he's yet to find the end-zone, Wheaton has played laudably to begin the season. On an appreciable 20 targets he's plucked 15 passes for 170 yards. He's also chipped in an additional 22 yards on the ground. Those aren't extraordinary numbers, but he has notched the 13th-best WR rating according to Pro Football Focus. That ranking should climb this week. In a slaughter only a fantasy owner could love, the sword-less Bucs, who must have been smashed on fine Caribbean rum, were gutted from start to finish by Atlanta, an embarrassing outcome for a defense many believed would be rock solid this year. Alterauun Verner is a shell of the shutdown corner he was with Tennessee. He and fellow CB Jonathan Banks have yielded a combined 126.6 QB rating and 85.2 catch percentage to their assignments. Harrrrible. Ben Roethlisberger and the Steelers passing attack sink the ship. "

S"The rather boisterous receiver might be a wee bit motivated to face the franchise that cut him loose this past offseason. He promised vengeful disembowelment shortly after his release and backed it up with an expletive-laced rant about his former employer during his thrashing of Cincinnati Week 1. Old, crotchety and angry 'senior' Smith is about to torch some whippersnappers. Out of the gate, the 35-year-old has chugged, not sipped, from the Fountain of Youth. He's attracted 10.6 targets per game, grabbing six receptions and 96.7 yards per game. His resulting 17.7 fantasy points per contest in PPR settings ranks top-10 among wideouts. Carolina, traditionally rigid against the pass, has softened this season. Corners Antoine Cason, Melvin White and Bene Benwikere have allowed a combined 69.2 catch percentage to their assignments, including a 10-grab (on 10 targets), 90-yard, 2-TD line from Antonio Brown last Sunday night. Absolutely jacked, Smith is must-start material in Week 4. "

S"Throughout the preseason the Jags said, ad nauseam, Blake Bortles would likely not see the field this fall. They planned to employ the Aaron Rodgers approach, forcing their prized pick to watch and learn from the sidelines. But because Chad Henne is only a whisker on  Brett Favre's bushy chin, their strategy quickly changed. Outscored 99-to-44 in three games, Gus Bradley called Bortles' number in the second half last week, a permanent change. Look for the new starter and fellow rookie Robinson to establish an instant connection. The Penn St. product, who battled hamstring setbacks in August, is healthy, active and quickly becoming a terror in the Jags offense. Blessed with excellent size (6-foot-2, 210-pounds), freakish leaping ability and run strength, the former high school hoops standout owns wondrous physical skills. Last week against the Colts, he earned the start over Allen Hurns, played 70-percent of team snaps and registered rosy numbers late (10 targets, 7 receptions and 79 yards). In a game with plenty of blowout appeal, he should again clean up in meaningless action. Though Michael Floyd is the only WR to surpass 70 yards in a game against them, San Diego corners Brandon Flowers, Shareece Wright and Jason Verrett have allowed a combined 97.6 QB rating and nearly 7.4 passing yards per attempt. They can be thrown on. Consider Robinson a prime Garbage Time All-Star candidate in Week 4. "

S'Cam\'s wide array of post-game attire has ranged from bowtie to "The Carlton" to, most strangely, Wookiee-inspired sweaters. However, his latest getup, Color Me Badd on top and eccentric Euro art collector on bottom, had many scratching their heads. So does his deflating fantasy production. In his first pair of starts since missing Week 1 with a rib injury, the normally versatile QB has abandoned his running ways. He\'s completed a praiseworthy 66.7 percent of his attempts for 265.5 passing yards, but totaling a mere 26 ground yards, his new pocket-tied approach has diminished his value. More of the same is on the docket. Newton was very efficient against Detroit and Pittsburgh consistently hitting targets in stride on short and long-range throws. His execution on play-action was especially sterling evident in his 96.6 QB rating in those situations. Still, the Ravens\' secondary has been unyielding in the early season. Andy Dalton, Ben Roethlisberger and Brian Hoyer each failed to eclipse 20 fantasy points in standard Yahoo leagues against it. Baltimore has recorded an uncharacteristic three sacks thus far, but Terrell Suggs and friends should collapse the pocket often against a loose O-line that\'s placed Netwon under pressure 38.3 percent of the time this year. Ultimately, until Newton starts scrambling, he\'s more QB2 than QB1 in 12-team leagues. '

S"Roughly six weeks ago, several fanalysts, yours truly NOT included, were screaming to avoid Jennings at all costs. Doubters claimed bruising rookie Andre Williams would dominate goal-line touches and eventually force an RBBC with the supposed 29-year-old plodder. Flash forward to the present day and Jennings has silenced even his harshest critics. The fifth-most value rusher in Fantasyland has averaged 127 total yards per game, gained 52.3 percent of his yards after contact and, most importantly, logged seven carries inside the 10 (Williams none), scoring twice. Though I absolutely adore Jennings and own numerous shares, this week's matchup with Washington is unfriendly. Rushers are performing 61.8 percent below the league average against it. Impenetrable between the tackles, the future Warriors have given up a lowly 2.67 yards per carry and the second-fewest fantasy points to RBs thus far. LeSean McCoy totaled a pathetic 22 yards on 20 attempts against Jim Haslett's 4-3 last week. Nasty. Jennings will get his usual 20-25 touches, but expect only modest results in Week 4. "

S"Incredibly, the Butter Squirrel, who's definitely earned his nuts over the first three weeks of the regular season, has not only outperformed tag-team partner McCoy, he's clotheslined him. Netting an obscene 0.49 fantasy points per snap, the miniature rusher has made the most of his opportunities in Chip Kelly's breakneck offense. Overall, his 19.1 points per game output in PPR settings ranks No. 6 among RBs. No doubt, he's been tremendous, but last week's spoonful of reality will likely be more the norm than the exception. Against a suddenly stingy Washington defense, he accounted for just 50 total yards on five touches. He also played just 21 snaps. Sans Aldon Smith and dealing with injuries in the secondary, San Francisco is in the midst of an identity crisis defensively. The 49ers have given up 22.7 points per game and recorded only four sacks. Still, the unit has done an excellent job bottling up RBs in the flat. DeMarco Murray, Matt Forte and Andre Ellington scraped 25 receiving yards or less against them. Patrick Willis and Michael Wilhoite in particular have done a terrific job chasing down vermin in the open field. Your sell-high window is about to close. "

S"I'm thoroughly convinced Johnson is allergic to the end zone. In his mind, an infectious cocktail of botulism, SARS and Ebola routinely festers in the invisible pool. The man hasn't scored a touchdown in 10 straight games. Though he's remained a valuable PPR commodity, the once unstoppable WR1 has morphed into a mediocre WR3. Still, despite the drop-off in fantasy production, many continue to buy the brand name, trotting him out weekly over upstarts like Kelvin Benjamin, Brandin Cooks and fellow Texan DeAndre Hopkins. Enough with the silliness. He'll likely attract his usual 8-10 targets against Buffalo's beatable secondary, a unit that's conceded the seventh-most fantasy points to wideouts on the young year. Targeted 38 times, Bills DBs Leodis McKelvin, Nickell Robey and Stephen Gilmore have given up 32 receptions (84.2 catch percentage). However, top corner Corey Graham, who will likely lock horns with Johnson often, has been a bright spot yielding 7.6 yards per catch and a 28.5 QB rating, the third-lowest in the league. Another worthwhile PPR line is in the offing, but don't expect him to find a cure for his TD affliction. "

S'Much to the delight of Vikings fans, it\'s officially "Teddy Time." Matt Cassel, sidelined by multiple foot fractures, is done for the season. Bridgewater, much like his first regular season appearance last week vs. the Saints, was wildly erratic in preseason action. At times he delivered crisp, accurate passes in tight spaces. However, in other instances, he overthrew intended targets, exhibited poor footwork and displayed the pocket presence of Josh McCown. And that\'s no endorsement. So goes the inconsistencies of a rookie QB. Patterson was fantasy TNT Week 1 (3-26-0, 102-1), but fizzled in Weeks 2 and 3. He enticed 12 targets in his last two, catching eight passes for 117 yards. Most vexing, he ran the ball only once. WTH, Norv?! At first glance, most would consider this week\'s matchup against Atlanta as quite favorable. On the year, the Falcons have allowed 7.6 passing yards per attempt. But that\'s not entirely the case. Starting corners Desmond Trufant and Robert Alford have played superbly. Each ranks inside the top-12 in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus surrendering a 52.1 catch rate to their assignments. Overall, No. 1 targets have averaged a profitless 37.4 yards per game vs. the duo. Patterson is always a threat to take a simple screen to the house, but considering the circumstances, another quiet afternoon is upcoming. '

S"Eli stink faces no more. After a laughable preseason and bumpy early start, the Giants offense is finally clicking. Over the past three weeks, the two-time champ has resembled the QB from three years ago. He's benefited from clean pockets (21.3 pressure percentage), spread the wealth and thrown strikes. During that stretch, he's completed 70.1 percent of his attempts, tallied an 8:1 TD-INT split and totaled a 104.9 QB rating. Hot diggity dog. Because of Rashad Jennings' excellent receiving and blitz pick-up skills, his absence will be felt. However, with Odell Beckham Jr. now in the mix and delivering as advertised and given the emergence of Larry Donnell, Younger Manning has an impressive arsenal at his disposal. Good thing. This week against the high-flying Eagles, he's going to need all the firepower he can muster. Philly, the most generous defense to fantasy quarterbacks, has surrendered 291.6 passing yards and 2.6 vertical strikes per game this season. Combined corners Carey Williams and Bradley Flectcher have allowed a 101.8 QB rating. In a game sure to play at a breakneck pace (Average snap count in Philly games this year is 80.2), Eli's arm gets overworked. Pump up the volume. Dance. Dance. "

S"Acquired off the discount rack by fortuitous owners a week ago, the pint-sized rookie from James Starks-U (Buffalo) cashed a colossal windfall in Week 5. When the Christian Ponder of RBs, Donald Brown, humorously ineffective over the past couple weeks (2.1 ypc), exited stage left with a concussion, the spotlight shined brightly on Oliver. Against a Jets defense entering the week which had yielded just 2.93 yards per carry, he bolted his way to 182 yards on 23 touches. Tough between the pipes, explosive and uber-versatile, he gained 62.3 percent of his yards after contact and forced six missed tackles, the same number it took Brown to accomplish on roughly 13 million more carries. At 5-foot-8, 210-pounds Oliver bears a striking resemblance to old school Maurice Jones-Drew. His short, compact build and deceptive power make him highly elusive. This week matched against a nonthreatening Raiders defense that's allowed 4.56 yards per carry to RBs, the kid is practically must-start material. Earlier this season, Chris Ivory, Chris Johnson, Arian Foster and Lamar Miller each had field days against Oakland. Even if Brown clears post-concussion protocol, expect Oliver to earn at least 15-18 touches. Hop aboard the bandwagon. The Bolt from the blue is a top-10 play in Week 6. "

S'Do you believe in miracles? If not, you should. Tate, back from a knee sprain that cost him multiple weeks, stunningly kept all tendons and bones intact in his return in Week 5. Against a generous Tennessee front seven, the fragile back bulled his way to 123 yards on 22 carries (5.6 ypc). When healthy, he\'s always excelled in a zone-blocking scheme. His one-cut ability, plus vision and interior power are a perfect fit. Isaiah Crowell and Terrance West will occasionally spell him, but he should remain the primary ball-carrier, behind one of the league\'s best offensive lines, moving forward. Dubbed "The Soft Curtain" back in August, the Steelers have lived down to expectations. They have surrendered the 10th-fewest fantasy points to RBs, but inferior rushing offenses (Carolina, Tampa Bay and Jacksonville) are responsible for the high ranking. Giving up 4.67 yards per carry to RBs, the unit remains exploitable. Tate was well on his way to a monster game (6-41-0) before exiting in the Week 1 matchup. In the second go-round, he picks up where he left off. '

S"The Jets' season can be summed up in a phrase: Refried booty. Rancid in virtually every way last week in San Diego, they are only accelerating Rex Ryan's presumed termination. Decker wasn't available in the debacle as a recurring hamstring ailment kept him on the sidelines. However, barring a setback in practice this week, he should return to the lineup in a tilt that will surely fuel his motivation. Denver DBs Chris Harris and Aqib Talib have, for the most part, locked down assignments this year. Combined the pair have allowed a 40.7 catch rate and 11.42 yards per catch to WRs. Still, because garbage time could start midway through the third quarter, Decker has strong odds of attracting double-digit targets. Of course, time-zone genius Geno Smith will actually have to show up to meetings and throw him a few catchable balls, but a top-30 finish is entirely likely. "

S"Losing Dennis Pitta to yet another hip injury was a serious blow to Joe Flacco and the Ravens' vertical attack, but thankfully, for fantasy and Baltimore fans, Daniels has elevated his game. Filling enormous shoes, he's played admirably, erasing thoughts of a TEBC in Charm City. Last week in Indy, he saw action on 58-of-60 snaps, attracting seven targets, catching five of them, for 70 yards. In fact, since Pitta's injury, Daniels has garnered 21 percent of the team's targets (H/T Mike Clay). The end zone has been unreachable, but this could be the week he finally splashes the invisible pool. Due in large part to their weak execution at linebacker and umbrella-like Tampa-2 D, the Sorrowful Swashbucklers have surrendered the third-most yards to tight ends (80.8). Look for Torrey Smith and Steve Smith to lure an extra defender, gifting Daniels several one-on-one opportunities underneath. Given the circumstances and matchup, Daniels frolics gleefully in the open field en route to strong TE1 numbers. "

S"The pride of Pittsburg State (Go Gorillas!) has delivered on his preseason promise. Compared to a young Marvin Harrison by Bruce Arians, the speedy wideout (4.31 40-yard time) has been sporadically effective whether with Carson Palmer or Drew Stanton at the helm. Brown's 7.4 fantasy points per game in standard formats ranks alongside brand names Michael Crabtree and Percy Harvin. His numbers suffered last week in Denver as the Broncos' constrictive secondary limited him to just two catches (on seven targets) for four yards. But with Palmer trending in the right direction, Brown is a strong bounce-back candidate. Down DeAngelo Hall, Washington has been incredibly giving to wide receivers. David Amerson and Bashaud Breeland have surrendered a 71.7 catch percentage and 103.5 QB rating on the year. Brown is very hit or miss, but based on the friendly matchup he's worth the risk at WR3. "

S"The Napoleon Dynamite of fantasy quarterbacks has fallen on hard times. He's repeatedly overthrown intended targets, produced only marginally in recent weeks and failed in his attempt to defeat Deb in tetherball. I've said this before and I'll say it again, underneath the surface Foles is seriously flawed. Compared to last season, he's regressed dramatically. According to Pro Football Focus, he's dead last among eligible quarterbacks in accuracy percentage and deep passing (11-for-42 on throws beyond 20 yards). Most egregiously, his 76.96 adjusted QB rating ranks only ahead of E.J. Manuel, Geno Smith and Blake Bortles. Stellar. To be fair, he remains one of the better play-action passers in the game and, largely due to Philly's inability to run the football and dizzying pace, continues to churn out high-volume outputs (40.8 pass attempts per game). Still, his sub-par production over the past two weeks combined with his homely underlying profile are cause for pause. So is his Week 6 opponent. Giants corners Prince Amukamura and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie have been outstanding. In total, they've allowed a 50.0 catch rate and 55.5 QB rating to their assignments. Only Matthew Stafford has thrown for multiple TDs against them. Foles' slow slide toward mediocrity is officially underway. "

S'For the Butler, friendly opponents are everything. In favorable tilts (e.g. NYG and Jax), he achieved fruitful RB1-level numbers. However, against average or stout run Ds (e.g. Philly and Seattle), he didn\'t exactly rise to the occasion. In other words, the man is far from matchup proof. After what Bruce Arians called "the dirtiest play" he\'s seen in 37 years of coaching, the Cardinals will attempt to overcome the incredible loss of defensive leader Calais Campbell. His absence along with a slew of other injuries has pinned AZ against the wall. Yet despite the tolls, the Desert Birds have found a way. Kareem Martin, Campbell\'s replacement, has giant shoes to fill, but the rookie and his cohorts should succeed in containing Morris. Linebacker Larry Foote has done a marvelous job stuffing RBs. He ranks top-10 among all LBs in run defense according to Pro Football Focus. Typically dogged inside The UPS, the Cards front line has also allowed just four touchdowns and 3.67 yards per carry to rushers in their past 10 home games. Morris will receive his usual 20-carry load, but expect only ordinary results. '

S"In a plot twist no fantasy player saw coming, the previous version of Shady, an unstoppable, versatile scoring machine, has vanished into thin air. Stupid alien abductions. Overnight it seems, the rusher has gone from gold to garbage. Philly's dilapidated offensive line deserves plenty of blame, but so does McCoy. Too often moving east-west instead of north-south, he's ran timidly, choosing to swing for the fences instead of taking the three-yard gain, a very Chris Johnson-like approach. Queasily, 47 of his 94 rush attempts (50.0 percent) have gone for one, zero or negative yards, up from 30.2 percent last year. Even when presented with exploitable matchups (e.g. St. Louis in Week 5), he couldn't spark a turnaround. Sadly, expect more of the same Sunday night. The Giants have conceded the 10th-most fantasy points to RBs this year. However, only Andre Ellington has cracked the 80-yard mark against them on the ground. New York has played loosely on designed dump-offs and screens \xe2\x80\x93 RBs are averaging 6.8 receptions per game against it \xe2\x80\x93 but McCoy has surrendered several touches to Darren Sproles in the pass game. Count on another RB2, not RB1, level performance in 12-teamers. "

S"Of all the rookie wide receivers from this year's loaded class, Benjamin unquestionably has been the most consistent. His height, condor-like wingspan and effective long-range speed have tied the hands of many defensive backs. Drops are problematic for the young wideout, but he's rapidly developed into one of the better deep ball weapons in the league. Whether PPR or standard, he's tallied a top-15 line through five games. However, the Bengals are an intimidating foe. Humiliated last week by Tom Brady in New England, Terrance Newman and Leon Hall will rebound at home. Including last week's debacle, they've allowed a lowly 8.9 yards per catch to their assignments and an overall 68.9 QB rating. Collectively, Cincinnati has given up only a pair of double-digit performers at WR this year (Steve Smith and Julio Jones). Because Cam Newton is living in the pocket, the rookie should again garner 8-10 targets. Still, given the unfavorable opponent, I'm betting on a mediocre return. "

S"V-Jax and Mike Glennon seriously need to get a room. Since Glennon regained the starting job, the tandem have been nearly inseparable. Over the past two games, Glennon has looked the receiver's way 22 times, connecting 11 times for 176 yards and a touchdown. Louis Murphy has allowed Glennon's eye to wander a bit, but it's safe to assume another handsome workload is on tap for Jackson. However, only satisfactory numbers are in the forecast. Largely due to its weak execution at safety, Baltimore has occasionally surrendered big plays downfield. On the year, they rank top-five in most 20-yard pass plays allowed.  Still, corners Jimmy Smith and Asa Jackson have thrived in coverage, conceding only 8.12 yards per catch. If Matt Elam and Darian Stewart can elevate their play, it will be an uneventful afternoon for Jackson. "

S"Watching Ben Stein recite a lengthy dissertation on the economic policies of Tajikistan. That essentially sums up fantasy owners' feelings about Smith. Due to his ultra-conservative, game-manager style most believe the veteran QB isn't worth 76 million Vietnamese Dong let alone U.S. Dollars. However, he's an efficient quarterback who rarely makes mistakes, the anti-Geno Smith. His 81.2 accuracy percentage ranks No. 1 in the league according to Pro Football Focus. At first glance, he may seem unappealing, but Smith is an underrated statistical asset. His yardage totals haven't exactly incited excitement (6.82 ypa, 211.7 pass yards per game), but he's accounted for three multi-TD performances in his past four contests, besting notable names Matt Ryan, Nick Foles and Matthew Stafford in per game output during that span. St. Louis, which shockingly ranked No. 1 in pass D just two weeks ago, has fallen on hard times. Embarrassed by multidimensional weapons Colin Kaepernick and Russell Wilson in consecutive weeks, the once prideful Rams now resemble cuddly Lambs. On the year, they've surrendered the second-most fantasy points per game to QBs. In fact, EVERY signal-caller has logged at least two TDs against them. And that includes future Canton inductees Matt Cassel and Josh McCown. Smith may have limited weapons, but his odds of piling up fruitful numbers against Janoris Jenkins (126.0 QB rating allowed) and company are rather significant. "

S'Remember this guy? When LeSean McCoy was felled by injury two years ago, the little-known product from Kansas State burst onto the fantasy scene. In four starts with the Eagles, he electrified the masses, totaling 5.4 yards per carry nearly 90 combined yards per game while scoring three times. Overall that season, he gained an impressive 67.7 percent of his yards after contact. Due to his occasional cases of fumblitis, he isn\'t someone you should trust holding grandma\'s fine china, but his explosion, aggressiveness, plus vision and versatility are highly attractive. As Fred Jackson noted Monday, Brown is "an every-down back." Anthony Dixon will remain involved, but there\'s a reason why the Bills gave up a conditional 2015 fourth-round draft pick for his services. He will be heavily deployed. The once formidable Jets have softened considerably in recent weeks. In their past three games, they\'ve yielded 4.14 yards per carry, 163.7 total yards per game and four touchdowns to running backs. Given the matchup and heightened workload, Brown is worth getting down with in deeper formats. '

S"Mea culpa. I was horribly, terribly, woefully wrong about Montee Ball. Please take away my privileges for dispensing shoddy free advice. Sidelined by a nasty groin pull, Ball, who averaged a forgettable 3.13 yards per carry on 55 attempts, likely won't regain his starting gig once available. Hillman, a former bust in his own right, has blossomed into a very useful every-down running back. The former San Diego St. standout, who broke several of Marshall Faulk's records in college, is no longer the weak, fumble-prone rusher from a couple seasons ago. He's mentally and physically stronger, darting through holes, catching passes and, most surprisingly, adequately protecting Peyton Manning. Against a string of normally stout defenses, the Cards, Jets and Niners, he compiled 4.71 yards per touch. He's only gained 40.8 percent of his yards after contact, but plowing over would-be tacklers isn't Hillman's game, nor does it need to be. Because of the nurturing offensive environment, he'll continue to see plenty of wide lanes, including this week. San Diego has been relatively stiff between the tackles, allowing just over 4.0 yards per carry to RBs. However, the Chargers have struggled defending the flat as rushers have tallied 6.8 receptions and 52.1 receiving yards per game. Thursday nights are always an adventure, but Denver's hot hand is highly employable in 12-team leagues. "

S'Norv Turner is obviously not dealing with a full deck. How many excuses can one man make? Allegedly the centerpiece of defensive game-plans, Patterson hasn\'t even made a squeak over the past three weeks. During that stretch, he\'s TOTALED six receptions and 32 yards. He did, stunningly, find the end zone last week, but the non-factor has done nothing but mystify the fantasy community. Blame Norm. Two weeks ago, the offensive brain surgeon was reportedly "anxious" to get his deadliest weapon more involved. Because of his lack of vision and creativity that has still yet to happen, prompting many to wonder if Turner failed finger-painting as a kid. Despite Patterson\'s uneventful production, he\'s someone worth rolling the dice on in Week 8. No defense has given up more fantasy points to WRs than Tampa. Eight receivers have crossed the 10-point threshold against it in PPR settings. Targeted 63 times, Bucs DBs Alterraun Verner and Jonathan Banks have surrendered 47 receptions (74.6 catch percentage). His toxicity is high, but this has to be the week Patterson burns the competition and not his fantasy owners. Pull head from keyster, Norval. '

S"The sophomore receiver is quickly becoming a modern day Cris Carter. Why? All the dude does is score touchdowns. More than just a deep threat, he's developed into one of the finer red zone receivers in the league. Lined in the crosshairs nine times inside the 20, he's hauled in five receptions, four of those for scores. In total, he's splashed pay-dirt six times. Though he's caught just 19 passes, the end zone dances have placed him No. 18 in per game average among wideouts. That ranking could rise this week against rival Washington. Sans DeAngelo Hall, the 'Skins secondary has floundered. Since Week 3, it's given up eight receiving touchdowns and the ninth-most fantasy points to WRs. Overall, David Amerson is the only Washington CB to rank inside the top-100 in pass coverage. Abominable. With Dallas seemingly unstoppable right now, Williams, who's averaging 17.8 yards per catch, again delivers a standout WR2 line. "

S"Prior to his hand injury, Ingram was a firm RB2 in 12-team leagues. Returning to action last Sunday for the first time in five weeks, he played 26 snaps totaling just 29 yards on 12 touches. Sean Peyton rarely strays from a revolving backfield and will continue to feed Khiry Robinson and Travaris Cadet occasionally, rendering Ingram a 11-15 touch rusher moving forward. But with Pierre Thomas shelved the next 2-3 weeks (shoulder), the ex-'Bama back should wind up on the high side of that range.  With that in mind, he's worth acknowledging in Week 8. Largely due to a couple friendly matchups (Minnesota and Carolina), Green Bay has improved on its once atrocious record against the run. Still, the Packers remain vulnerable in the trenches. On the year, they've conceded 146.5 combined yards and six touchdowns to RBs. In desperation mode, the Saints will turn to their power back, who's tallied 4.67 yards per carry, inside the red zone. "

S"What version of Cutler will make an appearance this week? The fantasy handsome Dr. Jekyll or his sinister alter-ego Mr. Hyde? With Halloween just around the corner and based on the passer's recent schlock play, it only seems appropriate the latter manifests in Foxborough. Cutler, called out by Brandon Marshall for his shoddy execution last week vs. Miami, is not exactly a well-liked individual currently in the Bears locker room. As he's done too often in his career, he's forced the issue, making poor decisions and awful back-foot throws that have disastrous results. His 74.2 QB rating, 5.59 yards per attempt and dreadful effort (0-for-4) on deep-ball attempts against the Dolphins was unsightly. With only two TDs to his name over the past two weeks, his QB1 image is far from impeccable. Looking at his Week 8 matchup, it's likely he'll only smudge it more. Darrelle Revis, who ranks No. 54 in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus, hasn't exactly isolated targets on an island. Allowing a 61.3 catch rate and 14.1 yards per catch, he's played average at best. Still, many in the Patriots defensive backfield have picked up the slack. Brandon Browner was decent in his return last week. Others, like Devin McCourty and Kyle Arrington, have also stepped up. Overall, only Alex Smith has reached the 20-fantasy-point mark in standard Yahoo formats against them. They've also surrendered just 6.88 yards per attempts and the fifth-fewest fantasy points to QBs. Jay won't pay this Sunday. "

S"Over the past three weeks, Oliver has written a Cinderella story. An undrafted rookie from Buffalo, he made some noise in the preseason but started the year fourth on the San Diego depth chart. Three major injuries to Ryan Mathews, Danny Woodhead and Donald Brown later, and the sparkplug has ignited a previously stagnate Chargers ground game. Since Week 5, he's totaled 128 combined yards per game and three touchdowns, gaining an impressive 62 percent of his yards after initial contact. Sadly, though, the clock strikes midnight for the kid this week. When it comes to defending the run, Denver rarely relents. Thanks to the stellar play of Von Miller and the other Brandon Marshall, running backs have found few holes. On the year, RBs have netted a ghastly 2.89 yards per carry against the Broncos. San Diego's patchwork offensive line will certainly have its hands full. Evidenced in the efforts of Ahmad Bradshaw, Marshawn Lynch and Andre Ellington, versatile rushers have inflicted damage in the pass game. With that in mind, Oliver, who's caught 14 passes in his past four contests, is still a useful PPR option. However, expect vanilla production on the ground, especially if Peyton Manning, facing a San Diego secondary sans Brandon Flowers, blows the doors off the building early. "

S"For those that invested a No. 1 pick in McCoy, liver expansion has occurred at an alarming rate. His bland efforts over the first several weeks left a bitter taste. However, his 154-total yard bounce-back against the Giants prior to the bye has his fans excited about the second half of the fantasy season. With the Philly offensive line getting healthy, things are looking up for Shady, but his Week 8 trip to Arizona could temporarily halt the comeback. Stretching back to last year, visiting RBs have averaged a disgusting 3.09 yards per carry inside the UPS. In fact, among that group, Marshawn Lynch is the only rusher to eclipse the 60-yard mark on the ground in the desert. And just four have found the end zone. It's a rather extraordinary accomplishment considering the loses of Darnell Dockett and Calais Campbell. Credit DC Todd Bowles' base 3-4 scheme. In a game with enormous playoff seeding implications, the Cards erect brick walls in the trenches. "

S"After tripping out of the gate, D-Jax has come on like gangbusters over the past few weeks. Clicking with Kirk Cousins, he compiled the seventh-best stat line among wide receivers from Weeks 3-7, amassing 17 receptions for 443 yards and three touchdowns. But with Captain Kirk now battling Klingons on Kronos, questions loom regarding the receiver's Week 8 value. Colt McCoy was magical in relief of Cousins last week going 11-for-12 for 128 yards and a TD. However, the elevated backup seemed to favor Pierre Garcon and Jordan Reed. More damning, McCoy's arm pairs nicely with chicken broth, it's a noodle. RG3, who practiced with the first-team Wednesday, could also return, greatly complicating matters. If No. 10 did start, how rusty would he be? Then there's the unsavory matchup. The shockingly good Cowboys defense has surrendered the second-fewest pass plays of 20-plus yards. Most impressively, top corner Orlando Scandrick has given up a mere 9.9 yards per catch. Given the difficult road environment, staunch opponent and QB uncertainties, Jackson could be in for a quiet night. "

S"Eight Pro Bowls. Six 1,000-yard seasons. 88 career touchdowns. There are few players in the NFL's 92-year history who have made a bigger splash at the wide receiver position than Fitzgerald. Unstoppable during the Kurt Warner years and a consummate pro when Kevin Kolb tanked the franchise, he's produced sound, consistent numbers for nearly a decade. Unfortunately, the 31-year-old isn't the same stallion he used to be. Currently the No. 64 wideout in Fantasyland on a per game basis, he's monumentally underachieved. He's hit pay-dirt only once and averaged an uncharacteristic 47.1 yards per game. He's still a physically imposing weapon, but the slot man isn't gaining separation from defenders, forcing Carson Palmer to look elsewhere. He's on pace for just 96 targets, which would be the lowest of his career. Philly presents a ripe opportunity to regain owner confidence. Cary Williams and friends have yielded the sixth-most fantasy points to WRs. However, linebackers Trent Cole and Connor Barwin have done an excellent job assisting DBs in the short-field, an area where Fitz typically operates. Because the Eagles are most exploitable on the outside, Michael Floyd and John Brown could be in for profitable days, leaving Fitzgerald fans vexed once again. "

S'Romo has done very little to rectify his blemished reputation. He followed up a Week 1 train-wreck against San Fran with an equally nauseating effort in Tennessee (176-1-0). He and Dez Bryant were virtually unstoppable at times, but the Cowboys offense was carried by thoroughbred, DeMarco Murray, to the finish line. As a result, the QB bottomed out at No. 29 among Week 2 signal callers, one spot behind the "all mighty" Matt Cassel. Through two games, Romo has only attempted six passes beyond 20 yards, completing one, choosing instead to attack defenses in the short-to-intermediate field. He\'s also been terrible on play-action posting a QB rating of just 38.0 in those situations. That lack of production downfield has justifiably prompted many to question how healthy his back really is. But this is the week Romo regains his QB1 mojo. Yes, the Rams have yet to allow a 175-yard passer, but they faced Cassel and Josh McCown in consecutive weeks. Overall, they\'ve surrendered 7.5 yards per attempt to passers and starting DBs E.J. Gaines and Janoris Jenkins have yielded a catch rate of 65.0 percent to their assignments. Don\'t be fooled by the superficial numbers. Since 2007, Romo has finished inside the QB top-10 in per game average every year. Though doubt is creeping in, this is the matchup that reassures owners he can still play at a starter-worthy level.

S"So far it's been the Year of the Bell. Pittsburgh's Le'Veon Bell has stiff-armed critics and the competition logging a top-three fantasy line over the first two weeks. His underpublicized compatriot, Joique, has also kept heads ringin', checking in at No. 16 in PPR settings. The versatile and powerful Lion has out-snapped (77-to-62), out-touched (16 tchs per game to 12)  and outproduced tag-team partner Reggie Bush. He's managed a mere 3.48 rushing yards per carry, but his contributions in the check-down game have padded the bottom line (7-66-0). On Sunday, Detroit hosts division rival Green Bay at Ford Field. To say the Packers' D is nonthreatening would be a gross understatement. When Geno Smith throws and runs his way to top-10 numbers, that's an indictment. Green Bay's added depth in its defensive backfield has helped, but its mushy makeup in the trenches remains an eyesore. The Pack has surrendered 4.91 yards per touch and the fifth-most fantasy points to RBs through two weeks. On the fast track, Bell tolls for thee."

S'He\'s no "Butter Squirrel," but Woodhead, similar to Philly\'s Darren Sproles, is a slippery weapon who\'s incredibly hard to contain in the screen game. A non-factor Week 1, he bounced back with a commendable effort last Sunday against the champs, totaling 60 yards on 12 touches (four receptions). Overall, he\'s seen 45.1 percent of the team\'s snaps. With Ryan Mathews sidelined the next 4-5 weeks, his role, along with Donald Brown\'s, elevates, possibly netting the RB some 12-15 touches per game. Down defensive backbone Kiko Alonso, the Bills have defended the run somewhat poorly. They\'ve yet to yield a ground touchdown, but their 4.77 yards per carry allowed to RBs hardly classifies them as "stiff." Now without the services of Keith Rivers (groin), they\'re even more susceptible. Linebackers Preston Brown, Nigel Bradham and Brandon Spikes have surrendered 18 receptions on 20 targets combined, a chuckle-worthy stat that shows Philip Rivers and Woodhead could nickel and dime the Bills to death. Brown is San Diego\'s power play, but his complement will be utilized heavily in the pass game, increasing his FLEX appeal in PPR formats. Interesting aside, Woodhead recorded the same number of red-zone touches (three) as Mathews in the Chargers\' first two contests. There\'s measurable TD potential here. '

S"It's all about the Benjamin, baby. The rookie, who crashed back down to earth last week after a fervent Week 1, is sure to stoke the fantasy fire yet again. Though he underperformed in a favorable matchup vs. the Lions in Week 2, he was still targeted eight times, the highest amount among Panthers wide receivers. At a rangy 6-foot-5, the Florida State product will continue to be Cam Newton's weapon of choice downfield. His height, push off press coverage and long-range wheels are TE-like attributes. In other words, he's a matchup nightmare for undersized defenders. Pittsburgh, as expected, has been rather exploitable defensively, particularly in the vertical game. Underneath dynamos Andrew Hawkins and Steve Smith housed them in consecutive weeks. Benjamin makes his hay typically on big plays, but, evident in his 1.94 yards per route run, he's also a midrange force. Through two games, he's grabbed four passes for 62 yards on 10-19-yard completions across the middle. Whether on the edge or between the hashmarks, the wideout should show well vs. Ike Taylor and Cortez Allen, a pair of DBs that rank outside the top-50 in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus. In his prime-time debut, Benjamin shines. "

S"The Lou, for the most part, has been a barren wasteland for fantasy purposes. That putrid smell emanating from the city isn't just the Mississippi. Zac Stacy hasn't exactly delivered on his RB2 promise. Meanwhile worthless Kenny Britt, talked up by several fanalysts as a preseason sleeper, remains in a non-factor. Because of the club's generally porous output, many have overlooked Quick. For the third-year wideout, the light in the attic has finally turned on. His sharpened routes and gained confidence have unlocked his WR3 potential. Undoubtedly the team's most reliable vertical asset, he's attracted 18 targets catching 14 balls for 173 yards through two games. With Tavon Austin cooked for the next couple weeks, he could average double-digit looks over the near-term, especially this week vs. the Cowpokes. Starting CBs Morris Claiborne and Brandon Carr rank No. 83 and No. 90 respectively in pass coverage per PFF. All told the un-dynamic duo has surrendered a 96.5 QB rating. Futile. Based on the matchup, Quick should finish well inside the WR top-36 in PPR, especially given the garbage-time potential. "

S"As Andy Behrens discussed earlier this week, Adams is a still widely available player who shouldn't be. In what may be a season full of impactful rookie wideouts (Benjamin, Brandin Cooks, Sammy Watkins, Mike Evans, Allen Hurns), the Fresno State alum could also make serious noise. Jarrett Boykin's impersonation of Victor Cruz last week against the Jets did him no favors. His brutal drop in the red zone has him firmly in Mike McCarthy's doghouse, a banishment that swings open the door of opportunity for Adams. After Boykins was benched, the youngster stood out, catching five passes for 50 yards (on seven targets), nearly missing a touchdown in the third quarter. He saw just 51.3 percent of the snaps Week 2, but after splashing onto the scene in the second half, his role, in an offense that features many three-WR sets, is sure to expand. Detroit's secondary has thinned noticeably since the season started. DBs Bill Bentley and Nevin Lawson are permanently shelved and James Ihedigbo, who's battled knee problems, has yet to see the field. In a clash that promises a buffet of fantasy goodness (Vegas over/under 52), Adams, who possesses the size (6-2, 212), leaping ability and separation skills to be highly effective, is a prime breakout candidate.

S'The Zoolander of the NFL hasn\'t won over owners with his :Blue Steel" look, UGG boots and mediocre fantasy performances. Blame the lack of suitable downfield targets. Week 1, playing from behind in Miami, he was a miserable 1-for-10 on pass plays beyond 20 yards. Despite uncorking 56 times, he managed just 249 yards and a touchdown. In Week 2 vs. the Vikes, he played game manager as Stevan Ridley and the opportunistic Pats defense did the heavy lifting. His resulting 149 yards and a TD drove many to the bottle. Essentially Brady has morphed into a dump-off QB, evidenced in his wretched 5.5 yards per attempt, a mind-blowing stat with a healthy Gronk. Though Tom Tepid\'s matchup Week 3 is quite favorable, tread lightly. The Raiders made Geno Smith look like Joe Namath Week 1 and were equally deplorable last week against Houston, pathetic efforts that have Dennis Allen squarely on the hot seat.  No Raiders DB currently ranks inside the top-50 in coverage according to Pro Football Focus. Still, similar to how last week\'s game in Minnesota unfolded, this contest could get out of hand quickly, again forcing Brady into a handoff-heavy role. Seek volume elsewhere (e.g. Josh McCown).'

S"When the Broncos and 'Hawks met in Super Bowl XLVIII, Denver compiled a laughable 27 rushing yards as it attempted to climb out of a massive early deficit. Peyton Manning, presumably very motivated, will do his damndest to exact revenge, but Ball remains a risky option. The sophomore rusher hasn't lit the world on fire through two games, netting just 3.6 yards per carry. However, on 40 touches he's forced 13 missed tackles, the third-highest amount in the league, and gained an outstanding 70.8 percent of his yards after initial contact. Despite his encouraging secondary numbers, the matchup does not bode well for Ball. Stretching back to last year, the 'Hawks have not allowed a rusher to surpass 80 total yards in five straight home games. And that was against the likes of Adrian Peterson, Andre Ellington, Zac Stacy and Eddie Lacy. Another 15-20 touch workload is surely on tap, but expect only modest production. Off a loss and with the always rockin' 12th Man behind it, Seattle is poised to toss Ball into the gutter. Stevan Ridley (vs. Oak), Donald Brown (at Buf) and Joique Bell (vs. GB) are more trustworthy alternatives. "

S"Among the Unroll Tide trio, Mark Ingram (RB5), Trent Richardson (RB36) and Lacy (RB47), stunningly, it's the Packer that currently ranks lowest on a per game basis. Blame an unfavorable early season schedule for the young back's sluggish start. Attritional wars against Seattle and the New York Jets crippled his overall production. In those two contests he was routinely stuffed, tallying 3.08 yards per carry on 25 attempts. Given the bearish market, it's silly to sell low. Though James Starks and DuJuan Harris will occasionally relieve him, he's still a rolling tank capable of a top-12 finish. However, this likely isn't the week he jumps back to the forefront. Against Rashad Jennings and Jonathan Stewart the Lions' D-line was practically immovable. Both backs did penetrate the end-zone, but amassed only 2.67 yards per carry. Ndamukong Suh, Stephen Tulloch and DeAndre Levy accounted for much of that stuffage. Already the threesome has totaled 28 stops. With matchups against Chicago and Minnesota upcoming, brighter days are in the forecast for Lacy, but this week demoting the top pick isn't a moronic move."

S'When asked Tuesday about how long Carson Palmer will be sidelined Cards head honcho Bruce Arians remarked, "it could be a day or it could be a month." That narrows it down. In other words, we have zero clue how much time the passer will miss due to a nerve issue in his throwing shoulder. It\'s highly likely Drew Stanton, who was generally awful last week in a win against the Giants, will again man the controls for \'Zona. If that\'s the case, Larry Fitzgerald (10-6-51-0 vs. NYG), and not Floyd (6-1-19-0), stands to benefit. Evident last week in New York, Stanton is not Kurt Warner Part II. In a pinch, he\'s a suitable game manager, but his constant misfires off play-action (36.4 completion percentage on 11 attempts in Week 2) and below average deep ball leaves a lot to be desired. In his career he\'s a horrendous 7-for-27 (25.9 percent) on passes beyond 20 yards. I\'m more accurate with my Flames/Lames picks for crying out loud. Because Floyd\'s production is fueled by big plays, he isn\'t the most fruitful option. Though torched by Jay Cutler and Brandon Marshall in the second half of last week\'s folding vs. Chicago, San Fran\'s secondary has thrown water on explosive pass plays allowing just four completions of 20-plus yards, the fourth-lowest in the league. Expected to be without Tramaine Brock, the defensive backfield is a bit thin, but due to Stanton\'s downsides deep, Floyd underachieves for the second straight week. '

S"On the other side of the ball, the Niners have their own problems vertically. In Greg Roman's expanded offense, Colin Kaepernick has looked respectable at times, completing 64.9 percent of his attempts while notching an 84.6 QB rating. However, similar to Stanton, he's struggled on play-action, finding his intended targets just 46.2 percent of the time. He is making strides, but remains a work in progress. Last week vs. Chicago, the QB and Crabtree made beautiful music together. Targeted nine times, the wideout hauled in seven passes for 82 yards and a touchdown, rebounding from a sleepy Week 1 (2-24-0 at Dal). Crabtree's history against Arizona is legendary. In his past three tangos with the division foe, he's found the end zone four times and averaged 5.3 receptions and 91.0 yards per game. Still, Antonio Cromartie and Patrick Peterson have executed at a high level through two games. The tandem has yielded a lowly 47.3 catch percentage to their assignments. In what could be a low-scoring defensive affair, don't expect the Niner to strike it rich. "

S'Every time the "elite QB" discussion is broached by mainstream analysts, it\'s always hilarious when Flacco is mentioned in the same breath as Peyton Manning, Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers. A Super Bowl ring isn\'t an automatic qualifier for greatness, nimrods. You gotta have stats to back up such a bold declaration. Numbers-wise the signal-caller is nowhere close to top-shelf, but through four weeks he hasn\'t exactly lived down to his mediocre fantasy reputation. Thanks to Steve Smith\'s rebirth, Flacco, despite averaging just 6.89 yards per attempt, ranks No. 12 among passers in per game output. He\'s already surpassed the 300-yard mark twice and tallied a pair of multi-TD games. Due in large part to a restrictive offensive line \xe2\x80\x93 he\'s been under duress only 25.8 percent of the time this year \xe2\x80\x93 he\'s dropped bombs more precisely and frequently. Last year, his 26.1 accuracy percentage on chucks beyond 20 yards ranked No. 39 of 40. Raising that rate to 50.0 percent through four weeks, he\'s cracked the top-five in the category. Down LaRon Landry due to a failed drug test (Shocker!), an already vulnerable Colts secondary is even more exploitable. Indy has yielded 7.95 yards per attempt and the 10th-most fantasy points to QBs so far. In a game with shootout appeal, Flacco is a fantastic plug \'n play option for streamers.'

S"Fat Albert on a motorized scooter. That's what Asiata looks like every time he moves with the football. The elevated backup is a traditional north-south smasher, a pedestrian runner (3.38 yards per carry) with considerable power (55.8 yards after contact percentage), but minimal speed. However, he's an exceptional pass-blocker and useful receiver, attributes which should keep him routinely on the field. Though he's nowhere near as flashy as electric teammate Jerick McKinnon, the starter has been a waiver wire godsend. Boosted by a TD hat trick last week vs. Atlanta, he's cranked out the eighth-best line in PPR formats though four games. The rookie upstart will slowly wrest away carries, but Asiata should continue to see 55-65 percent of team snaps and 15-18 touches per game, especially this week. Green Bay offers little resistance at the point of attack. Highly exploitable in the trenches, the Packers have surrendered 4.24 yards per carry, 176.7 total yards per game and five touchdowns to RBs on the season, equal to the fourth-most fantasy points allowed. Last week, Matt Forte and Ka'Deem Carey alone accounted for 194 ground yards against them. In terms of skill set, Asiata is about as exciting as a TV dinner, but count on him as an RB2 in Week 5.   "

S"Pittsburgh's OG Kush to its Sour Diesel (Le'Veon Bell), Blount has proven occasionally useful through four games. He's found the end zone twice and, in a blowout win against Carolina, rolled his way to 118 yards on just 10 carries. When awarded opportunities he's slammed his way over and through opponents, evident in his 76.4 yards-after-contact percentage. Averaging just 5.3 carries per game, he's clearly a complementary piece, but his workload could expand this week against the hopeless Jags. Outscored 157-to-58 through four games, the NFL's new Hello Kitties have fallen into deep holes early and often. As a result, many secondary and even tertiary rushers have thrived in garbage time. Darren Sproles, Silas Redd and Branden Oliver each recorded serviceable numbers against them. Heck, even Trent Richardson registered a pulse in his Jags matchup, impossibly crossing the 4.0 yards per carry threshold. It's always a risk to entrust a light-working RB, but Blount has serious FLEX appeal in deeper leagues."

S"If Quick lived in a zipcode tied to major market teams like the Jets/Giants, Niners or Bears, even the most novice fan would recognize him. But sequestered in St. Louis, he's gone virtually unnoticed in shallow leagues. The third-year wideout is a name to know. His 16-253-1 line checks in at No. 16 among wide receivers in PPR, outpacing the likes of Brandon Marshall, Roddy White and Pierre Garcon. Despite his established rapport with Austin Davis and strong overall start, he's regularly left on owner benches. Don't make that mistake this week. Philly DB Brandon Boykin, when on the field, has played well slotting in at No. 15 in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus. However, starters Bradley Fletcher and Cary Williams have conceded a 99.4 QB rating thus far, pushing the duo outside the top-55 in pass coverage. Rejuvenated after the bye, Quick, tallies his third game of five-plus receptions this year with little fanfare. "

S'The "other" Floyd may have the neck of a diplodocus, but unlike the prehistoric reptile, he\'s no thundering plodder. Different from teammate Keenan Allen, his game is tailored almost exclusively for the deep ball, indicative in his ridiculous 20.8 yards per catch average. That long-range explosiveness could prove problematic for a Jets secondary ravaged by injuries and ineptitude. With Dee Milliner saddled by a bum quad and ankle, schlubs Darrin Walls and Antonio Allen have given up a 62.7 catch percentage and 107.1 QB rating to their assignments. Most weeks, due to his unsavory volume (3.7 targets per game), Floyd isn\'t a recommended play in PPR, but the fruit is hanging low. He and Philip Rivers are sure to connect on a big gainer or two. For the fourth time in five weeks, the Charger cracks the WR top-30. '

S'In many instances, players wind an unconventional path to the pros. Crowell is a prime example. A coveted five-star recruit out of high school rated top-four by both Scout and Rivals, the Columbus Carver (GA) product signed on the dotted line with nearby SEC power Georgia. His career with the Bulldogs, however, was abbreviated. He earned SEC Freshmen of the Year honors in 2011, totaling 915 yards from scrimmage and six touchdowns in 12 games. But arrested on a felony weapons charge the following year, he was dismissed. Earning a second chance at Alabama St. and with the charges eventually dropped, he continued to develop and excel netting 5.97 yards per carry from 2012-2013. Now in Cleveland, the college vagabond is planting firm pro roots. With Ben Tate inactive, he played second fiddle to Terrance West, but made the most of his limited opportunities. Powerful, dynamic and tough, he\'s tallied 5.2 yards per carry and the second-highest breakaway percentage (48.9) among RBs, an effort which has triggered "feed the Crow" demands from locals. Even with Tate expected back in uniform this week, the rookie should dig in against a Titans front that\'s surrendered nearly 114 rushing yards per game and five ground scores to RBs, equal to the ninth-most fantasy points allowed. Bank on 10-12 carries and a FLEXY sexy day. '

S"Whether it's the air travel, uncomfortable beds, grass tracks or slipped laxatives, something has negatively affected the homebody's performance on the road. Over his past 10 games away from the creature comforts of the Georgia Dome, Ryan has failed to eclipse 20 fantasy points in standard formats six times. To be fair, he skewered a Vikings secondary to the tune of 298 yards and three touchdowns on the road, but he also tossed two interceptions. With Julio Jones practically uncoverable, Roddy White nearing full health and little ground game to lean on, most would consider Ryan a lock for QB1 numbers in Week 5. But discounting the Giants is a terrible mistake. Fresh off a thrashing of Kirk Cousins and Washington, DBs Prince Amukamura and Dominque Rodgers-Cromartie enter this week with heads held high. On the year, the tandem has routinely dominated the opposition. Combined they've surrendered a 51.4 QB rating and 47.7 catch percentage. The duo ranks second only to Denver's Chris Harris and Aqib Talib in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus. Ryan has found pay-dirt at least three times in three of four games, but I'm not betting he takes a bite out of the Big Apple. "

S'Every year only a select group of commodities are tabbed "matchup proof" by the fantasy community. Usually, they\'re defined as high-volume players in ideal situations who\'ve performed unfailingly over an extended period of time. Lynch, to most, is one such commodity. Though the tag applies in many ways, no player is 100 percent foolproof. Disastrous performances afflict everyone. Even when LaDainian Tomlinson established the new NFL record for touchdowns in a season by a RB (2006), he didn\'t cross the 10 fantasy point threshold twice in 16 games. Again, no mortal is immune. Since 2012, Lynch has achieved "Flame" status 71.5 percent of the time, making him a true consistency king. However, this week his crown will be tarnished. Washington, one of the more bendable rush Ds in the land last year, has righted the ship between the hashmarks. Due to the stellar play of Brian Orakpo and others, rushers have compiled a mere 3.24 yards per carry and 77 rushing yards per game against it. Equally impressive, only one RB has recorded a 20-plus yard run on the \'Skins. Lynch will get his customary 18-22 carry load, but "Least" Mode makes a guest appearance. '

S'Fantasy\'s divine child returned in spectacular fashion Monday. Against the wayward Pats, he totaled 108 yards and logged a TD hat-trick in a humiliating victory. Outside of cramps, he emerged from the game relatively unscathed. But this week brings a much stiffer test. The Niners, still huffing and puffing from their slow start, remain a hungry team despite upending Philly last week. Defensively, they\'re not the impregnable castle they\'ve been the past couple of seasons. Aldon Smith\'s absence has certainly taken a toll. Still, they\'re hardly the Jags of the Left Coast, especially when sniffing out the run. Thus far, they\'ve yielded 3.44 yards per carry and the second-fewest fantasy points to RBs. More specifically, Patrick Willis and friends have done a marvelous job collapsing on versatile running backs. DeMarco Murray, Andre Ellington, Matt Forte and Darren Sproles were all held to 25 receiving yards or less. Because of his blazing jets, Charles is always one missed assignment away from a house call. However, on the road, facing an inflexible opponent and likely to cede 8-10 touches to Knile Davis, he is prime "Lame" material. BLASPHEMY?! I think not. '

Just as dazzling under the hood, he ranks inside the top-12 in WR rating, yards per route run and deep-ball catch percentage according to Pro Football Focus. However, with Wes Welker back in the mix, Julius Thomas expected to take on a larger role and Demaryius, who's dealt with a nagging foot injury, presumably at or near 100 percent, his glorious start could morph into an uneven ending. Arizona's unblemished record can be largely attributed to its defense. Its frontline has received the most praise, but its backfield also deserves credit. DBs Jerraud Powers, Patrick Peterson and Antonio Cromartie have given up a combined 11.21 yards per catch. Cromartie has also surrendered a 47.9 QB rating and 40.0 catch percentage to his assignments. Off consecutive 100-yard efforts, Sanders regresses to the mean. "

S'Imagine rolling around in cow manure then attempting to swat off pesky flies for hours on end. That\'s what it must feel like for a wide receiver against Richard Sherman, Earl Thomas and Kam Chancellor. Though "exposed" a bit by Philip Rivers and San Diego a couple weeks back, the menacing \'Hawks have again been up to their fantasy-reducing ways. On the year, Sherman and Thomas have surrendered a 52.3 QB rating and 40.0 percent catch rate to assignments. Overall, Seattle\'s secondary has given up the ninth-fewest fantasy points to wide receivers. Jackson is arguably one of the best downfield weapons in the game, but still limited somewhat by a shoulder injury and with uncertainty over Kirk Cousins growing, he\'s a highly suspect play. Keep in mind 56.1 percent of completed passes Seattle has allowed have gone for gains of 10 yards or less. Odds of even a marginal fantasy day are not in D-Jax\'s favor. '

S"I'm convinced Tannehill could eradicate Ebola worldwide, usurp Kim Jong-un and save all whales and the fantasy community still would not give him proper recognition. Despite ranking as the 11th-best signal-caller in per game average this year, he's minimally started, even in highly competitive leagues. Yes, his misconnections with Mike Wallace are maddening, but his ability to score fantasy points via ground and air are attractive qualities. Five times in his past seven contests he's topped the 20 fantasy point mark in standard Yahoo leagues, yet no one gives two poops. Wake up and smell the stats. This week, Miami walks into the hornet's nest. The Broncos, fresh off an abysmal offensive performance in St. Louis, are incensed and in dire need of a win. They remain on track for the second season, but if they have any shot of hosting multiple playoff games, they can't lose another contest. Chris Harris and Co. have given up only 6.09 yards per attempt this year, but five quarterbacks have thrown for two or more touchdowns against them since Week 7. In a contest with possible garbage-time appeal, Tannehill cranks the volume to 11. Keep in mind, passers are averaging 42.2 attempts per game vs. Denver, the most in the league.  If Charles Manson can find true love at age 80, Tanny can easily penetrate the position's top-five. "

S'Rams offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer is a master in the art of B.S. It\'s his initials after all. Five weeks ago, Mason, coming off a breakout effort against Seattle (18-85-1) was still immersed in a hard-to-read committee. Schotty, ever the deceiver, said the Rams backfield would remain a "hot-hand" situation for the rest of the season. However, given Zac Stacy\'s complete suckitude and Benny Cunningham\'s general irrelevance, Mason is and will continue to be the main man. Off his first 100-yard game of the season, an impressive performance vs. one of the league\'s most unyielding run defenses, Denver, the War Eagle should again soar. Due to Eric Weddle and Jarrett Johnson\'s gap-plugging ways, few rushers have gashed the Chargers. In fact, only Jamaal Charles and Ronnie Hillman have surpassed the 85-yard mark against them. Still, Mason, quickly developing into a quality power back, has gained nearly 58 percent of his yards after contact, inflicting damage against some of the stiffest opponents around. Throw in San Diego\'s shortcomings stopping the pass and the Rams\' little steam engine should chug his way to at least a top-15 line. '

S'Anderson, thrust into the lead role after Hillman suffered a mid-foot sprain in Oakland, managed just 29 yards on nine carries against a suddenly inflexible Rams front. However, his eight receptions for 86 yards salvaged an otherwise marginal day, particularly in PPR settings. Because Montee Ball re-aggravated his groin injury Sunday and with Hillman out up to an additional five weeks, the former Cal Bear is set to ransack the competition. Juwan Thompson may give him a breather or two, but 15-20 touches should be the norm rest of season. What\'s most attractive about Anderson is his versatile skill set. Even in games where the Broncos offense mysteriously disappears, he will play a substantial role. Miami is notoriously unforgiving to fantasy running backs. The \'Fins have allowed only 3.76 yards per carry to RBs. Overall, just five rushers have achieved "Flame" status against them. Still, at home, I fully expect Peyton Manning to take out his frustrations gifting Anderson a handful of goal-to-go opportunities. '

S'The anticipation for Gordon\'s return ranks right up there with the new Star Wars movie. Hop into the Millennium Falcon kids. Cleveland\'s "Chewy" is about to take your team to light speed. In the Twitter verse, #TeamHuevos members have peppered me with questions about whether or not to trust Gordon in his return. They fear his extended layoff will lead to visible rust. He isn\'t Miles Austin folks. Recall, this was the position\'s leading performer on a per-game basis last fall. In an offense desperate for downfield production, his breakaway wheels, plus size and ball-adjustment skills are the perfect remedy. Kyle Shanahan, who sounded like a chocolate covered Augustus Gloop when asked about Gordon\'s return late last week, can\'t wait to unleash his "X" receiver. Atlanta\'s secondary is good at one thing and one thing only, inconsistent execution. Desmond Trufant has occasionally played up to snuff, but with Robert Alford out the next 2-4 weeks, the Falcons are highly toast-able. Alford\'s replacement, Robert McClain, gave up 18.5 yards per catch in Week 11. On the season, WR1s are averaging a very healthy 73.7 yards per game against Atlanta. His three-month ordeal is finally over. It\'s time for Gordon to earn his Snausages. Activate him with the utmost confidence. (Admission: Ok, this is a layup, but I really wanted to toss in my two cents about Gordon\'s prospects this week.)'

S'When fantasy owners hear the words "ankle sprain," expletive infused reactions often follow. Severity varies, but it\'s an injury that often ails victims for significant durations, sometimes multiple weeks. That, unfortunately, is the case for Dwayne Allen. The consistency king, who\'s found the end zone seven times in eight games, may not be available this week and beyond, paving the way for Fleener to solidify his standing as a TE1. Grossly underrated, Andrew Luck\'s old Stanford teammate has frequently churned out top-12 numbers without much fanfare. His 7-144-0 line against New England Sunday night was his latest and finest top-shelf performance of the season. Unfavorably known for his persistent butter hands, many have purposely ignored Fleener, but he\'s improved his routes and botched just three passes on 49 targets this year. The last time he matched up against the Jags, Fleener totaled a quite functional 4-49-1. Allen netted a similar 4-43-1. Add in Ahmad Bradshaw\'s absence in the pass game and it\'s entirely conceivable he flirts with top-five numbers. Ride that horse. '

S"Featured in this space a couple weeks back, Stills is once again an undervalued receiver with top-30 potential. My early season man-crush, Brandin Cooks, now the meat component in the fantasy stew, broke his thumb in Week 11. Placed on IR, he's done for the year. The explosive Oklahoma product is best known for his aerodynamic doo and long-range pass-catching skills. However, as his 12.5 aDOT (average depth of target) suggests, he really isn't a one-trick pony. Many of his catches this season have come on intermediate routes, mostly sideline outs in the 10-19 yard range. He's averaged a pedestrian 4.4 targets per game, but with Cooks out of action, an uptick in looks is likely. Yes, Drew Brees, the Friedrich Engels of quarterbacks, will continue to spread the wealth and Travaris Cadet should also see increased work underneath, but I suspect 7-9 targets are on the immediate horizon. Baltimore, burned by injuries and ineptitude, sports one of the league's most exploitable secondaries. Even with Jimmy Smith on the field for eight games, the Ravens have surrendered 3.5 pass plays of 20-plus yards per game, the 10th-most in the league. On the road, Baltimore's patchwork pass D is sure to get shredded. Debate Stills' merits as a WR3 in 12-team and deeper leagues. "

S"Just three weeks ago, Rivers was practically an every-week lock as a QB1, even in 10-team leagues. His sparkling 20:5 TD:INT split and resulting 21.3 fantasy points per game placed him No. 5 at the position. However, consecutive yack-worthy performances later (138-0-3 at Mia and 193-1-0) and doubts have started to creep in. Attacked on 36.5 percent of his drop-backs during that two-game stretch, he's crumbled under the pressure. San Diego's patchwork offensive line combined with a stagnant run game have spoiled his production. Though the Rams, who surrendered multi-TD efforts to QBs in five of their first six games, have been hampered at times vertically, they've showed substantial improvement of late. Highlighted by a masterful containment of Peyton Manning last week, relatively speaking, St. Louis has yielded only three passing touchdowns and the 10th-fewest fantasy points to passers since Week 8. Its remarkable badgering of signal-callers (15 sacks in their last four) has grounded the opposition. Rivers, already dealing with a tender knee and possibly ribs, is sure to get swarmed under early and often behind the league's second-worst pass-blocking line. If you own him, consider alternatives (e.g. Josh McCown, Ryan Tannehill and Mark Sanchez). "

S'Based on their last two pathetic exhibitions, the \'Skins offense has resembled Morris\' 1991 Mazda 626, pre-reconditioned. Clunky, pedestrian and stuck in park, Washington looks absolutely lost leading up to and since RG3\'s return. Much of its ineffectiveness can be pinned on a makeshift offensive line. Down several key "hogs," the unit put Griffin under duress 50 percent of the time against Minnesota and Tampa. Despite the team\'s ineptitude, Morris has kept on trucking. In his past two contests, he\'s averaged 4.8 yards per carry, scored twice and netted 120.5 total yards per game. His tough running between the pipes and increased role in the pass game are certainly encouraging. Still, he\'s a mediocre at-best option by the Bay. The Niners haven\'t skipped a beat defensively sans Patrick Willis. Aldon Smith\'s activation combined with Chris Borland\'s exceptional play have shut offenses down, particularly at the point of attack. Last week, Giants rushers averaged a hideous 3.09 yards per carry against them. More impressive, only three RBs (DeMarco Murray, Ronnie Hillman and Mark Ingram), have scored 10-plus fantasy points vs. the Gold Panners on the year. In a contest sure to rankle every Washington fan, the Butler gets served.  '

S'Most would argue mentioning the position leader in touchdowns, a true consistency king, in this space is like putting Kevin Spacey atop a list of worst actors \xe2\x80\x93 utterly comical. However, disregard the name for a minute, open your mind and listen to the argument below. It\'s quite compelling. Stretching back to Week 1 last year, running backs are averaging a ghastly 3.29 yards per carry and 63.8 rushing yards per contest against the Arizona Cardinals. Most discouraging, only one RB, Frank Gore Week 6 2013, has notched a triple-digit effort on the ground against them, a span of 27 games. Despite a myriad of injuries to supposedly irreplaceable players (e.g. Darnell Dockett), the Desert Birds continue to drop little "presents" on fantasy owner windshields. No doubt, Lynch is the most brutalizing rusher in the league. This fall, he\'s forced 50 missed tackles on 177 attempts and notched a 57.9 yards after contact percentage. A cannon blast at close range probably wouldn\'t take him down. Still, he\'s struggled against the division rival in recent years. In his last eight meetings against \'Zona, he failed to total 11 or more PPR points (.75/rec) six times. Arizona, quite possibly the most dissed 9-1 team in NFL history, is hungry to prove it can topple anyone, anywhere. Marshawn should again tote the rock 20-plus times, but look for Calais Campbell and Co. to hold Mr. Skittles under 100 yards. It\'s entirely likely, given how well Antonio Cromartie and Patrick Peterson have executed in single coverage, Todd Bowles loads the box and dares Russell Wilson to beat his club vertically. Hey, they don\'t call me the CEO of #TeamHuevos for nothing.'

S'In a season loaded with surprises at wide receiver, LaFell is one of the biggest. Practically dead-weight while a Carolina Panther, he\'s blossomed into a highly reliable contributor. Benefiting from Tom Brady\'s superheated streak and with attention drawn to Gronk, LaFell\'s averaged a robust 16.9 fantasy points per game in the "Flames/Lames" format since Week 4, the 13th-best output at the position. Still, much of that production came against soft competition (Buf, NYJ, Chi), a luxury he won\'t have in Week 12. Everyone talks about Detroit\'s impregnable defensive line, but the secondary has been equally unyielding. Corners Rashean Mathis and Darius Slay have allowed a combined 56.3 catch percentage and 79.6 QB rating to their assignments. In fact, only six wideouts have scored at least 10 fantasy points against the Lions this season. With those stats in mind, it\'s no wonder why they\'ve surrendered the third-fewest fantasy points to the position. Brady is off his rocker right now, but I suspect LaFell tallies only marginal numbers Sunday. '

S"From the start of training camp through the end of the calendar year, the physical punishment players endure is quite taxing. Many carry on despite the often unbearable pain. Others submit to the violent game's repercussion. Fitzgerald, one of the NFL's toughest wideouts, belongs to the former group, but for his unsure owners, they wish he was part of the latter. Planning to play through a Grade 2 MCL sprain in his right knee, the former All-Pro is completely untrustworthy in Week 12. His cutting limitations, unfavorable matchup and absent chemistry with Drew Stanton (36.5 yards per game, 0 TDs in four games) are all deterrents. In a contest that's sure to be a low-scoring affair, Fitz acts as decoy. Kenny Britt (at SD), Cecil Shorts (at Ind) and Chris Hogan (vs. NYJ) are better dice rolls. "

S"Don your most turquoised bolo and get overly animated, Rivers is sure to flood your team with points. It's been tough sledding for the quarterback in recent weeks. In three of his past four contests he's failed to tally 20 or more fantasy points. Placed under duress 33.5 percent of the time, he's posted the sixth-highest sack percentage over that stretch, one of many reasons why he hasn't resembled the QB1 from earlier this year. But, this week, bank on him recapturing the top-10 magic. The last time Rivers faced the division foe, he strung together a profitable line (253-3-2). Despite a couple of costly picks, his re-dedication to Keenan Allen enhanced his final numbers and likely carried owners to victory. In the rematch, this time in sunny SoCal, he could pack a stronger punch. Denver CB Chris Harris, the No. 1 ranked DB in pro football, has conquered the competition. However, because of Peyton Manning's usually infallible execution, opposing passers are frequently thrust into high volume scenarios against the Broncos, especially those on teams with sketchy secondaries. Signal-callers have averaged 41.4 attempts per game against Denver, the highest output in the league. Couple that with Aqib Talib (No. 77 in pass coverage) and Bradley Roby's (104.8 QB rating allowed) generally dreary play, and the Bolt is sure to shine. "

S"The biggest development in Oakland's stunning upset of San Francisco wasn't the final nail in the coffin for Mr. Pleated Pants (Jim Harbaugh) or the featherbrained idea to shower Tony Sparano, the head coach of a two-win team, with Gatorade, it was Murray's expanded workload. HALLELUJAH! The sophomore rusher didn't light the world on fire, totaling a rather pedestrian 85 yards, but his 25 touches were a breath of fresh air. It appears running back refuse, Darren McFadden and Maurice Jones-Drew, were finally tossed into the incinerator, elevating Murray into a rest of season workhorse role. The last time the rising rusher faced Kansas City, in Week 12, he posted quite possibly the most efficient line in the history of fake football. Before a concussion cut his evening short, he exploded for 112 yards and two touchdowns on just four carries. Obviously, the Chiefs won't be blindsided by the youngster a second time and will game-plan for him, but if Derek Carr executes at the level he did last week vs. San Fran, stacked boxes won't be omnipresent. It also helps KC would probably give up at least 75 rush yards to a one-legged Curtis Enis. On the year, RBs have blasted the Chiefs to the tune of 5.08 yards per carry. Bet on Black. "

S"I know what you're thinking. You would rather bear witness to a photo shoot where Rex Ryan recreated Kim Kardashian's greased-backside snap than trust a Jet during the most important week of the season. That viewpoint is 100 percent permissible. However, Johnson is an appealing option in a venue with a certain sense of familiarity to the RB. Not long ago, CJ2K was the most feared running back in the league. His superhuman speed and well-rounded game were virtually unmatched. During his six-year stint in Nashville, he amassed nearly 10,000 yards from scrimmage and splashed pay-dirt 58 times. Unfortunately, the organization's downward spiral coupled with a deteriorating skill set made Johnson expendable. As a Jet, he's only shown glimpses of his former brilliance, but in a game with considerable personal meaning, CJ could exhibit Pro Bowl form. The Titans defensive line is a wall of pillows. On the year, only Atlanta and Cincinnati have surrendered more fantasy points to RBs. When you give up 131 yards to plodder Andre Williams, that exemplifies how wretched you really are. Including Williams, Tennessee has allowed 100-plus total yards to a RB in five straight tilts. Johnson, who's toted the rock 35 times the past two games, is sure to add to that total. Remember the ex-Titan in 12-team and deeper leagues. "

S"Almost identical to his senior season at USC, it's been an uneven transition to the pro game for Lee. Talked up late in the summer, he was eventually overshadowed by fellow rookie Allen Robinson, barely registering a blip on the fantasy radar. However, with Robinson cooked for the season, Lee has quietly turned it on over the past three weeks. Earning more snaps (69.8 percent seen) and Blake Bortles looks (21) over that span, he's grabbed 14 passes for 167 yards and a touchdown. Lee isn't a burner by any stretch, but his physicality off the line and sharp routes have allowed him to compromise defenses underneath, very similar to what Jarvis Landry has done to opponents down Interstate 95. The Ravens secondary rose to the occasion last week against Landry's Dolphins, holding Ryan Tannehill to a mere 227 passing yards and 6.87 yards per attempt. Still, it remains the most exploitable unit in the league. No defense has surrendered more fantasy points to WRs than Baltimore. Against Asa Jackson (75.8 catch rate, 116.4 QB rating allowed) and future cut casualty LarDarius Webb (72.7, 116.8), Lee creeps inside the WR top-36. "

S"The Redskins, just like nearby politicians, are an irreparable, fractured bunch who've accomplished little. Injuries, particularly on the offensive line, are partially to blame, but the club has resembled a man-less dingy adrift at sea -- lonely, lost and useless. DeSean Jackson, when healthy, has continued to pile up points, but Garcon has gone the opposite direction. A victim of poor quarterback play, the wide receiver, largely drafted inside the first six rounds of 12-team drafts, has been one of the biggest busts this season. His 58-602-3 tally and resulting 6.0 fantasy points per game rank No. 59 among wide receivers, well off the projected top-30 pace most anticipated. Despite his spiritless production, Garcon is worth the risk in Week 15. No matter if Colt McCoy or Robert Griffin III hold the reins, the wideout should finally prove serviceable. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie has excelled in coverage this season, but the complementary pieces around him since Prince Amukamura's departure haven't. Zack Bowman, for example, has allowed a whopping 20.2 yards per catch to his assignments. Garcon managed just two catches for 28 yards in the first clash with New York in Week 4. However, off his finest performance in weeks, a nine-catch 95-yard effort against St. Louis, he notches at least FLEX worthy stats in 12-team and deeper PPR formats. "

S'There\'s nothing more disheartening to see one of your idolized players, on pace for a monster game, leave the stadium in an ambulance. Sadly, that was the case for Brandon Marshall last Thursday vs. the Cowboys. Scarily suffering a collapsed lung and broken ribs, the almost irreplaceable PPR asset won\'t play another down this season. For Wilson, opportunity knocks. Classified as a deep sleeper by several fantasy pundits in the preseason, the projected slot receiver has essentially been fantasy bankrupt. A broken collarbone suffered in early August sidelined him for multiple weeks. Even when on the field, he\'s been an afterthought, collecting just five receptions for 40 yards in four contests. Still, he\'s a fascinating prospect with a primo shot to showcase his wares over the next three weeks. At 6-foot-4, 185-pounds, he\'s a lanky long-strider who can really elevate. He isn\'t the fastest receiver on the planet (4.51 40-yard speed), but he\'s an unrefined version of Mike Evans, an oversized target who\'s capable of humiliating smallish corners. Now sliding into the "X" role in a vertical-heavy Bears offense, he could deliver lucrative WR3 totals immediately. His likely Week 15 shadow, Corey White (68.7 catch rate allowed), ranks dead last (No. 113 of 113) among CBs in pass coverage per Pro Football Focus. Overall, the Saints have given up the sixth-most fantasy points to WRs. In a game with plenty of shootout appeal, Wilson is slated to be the breakout star of your semifinals. '

S'Russell, please stop talking directly to my television screen. You\'re not Ferris Bueller and I\'m not your "champ." Now that we have that understanding, I want to make it abundantly clear, I admire your skills as a football player. You\'re incredibly cunning, accurate and multidimensional, a certifiable dreamboat for fantasy purposes. What you accomplished last week in Philly (263-2-0-48-1) almost bounced me in two leagues. Well-played. However, I\'m betting Pete Carroll and Darrell Bevell encourage you to take a more conservative approach in your rematch this week with San Francisco. Yes, the Niners are falling apart in most facets, but they continue to exhibit a stingy defense. Excluding your mediocre fantasy performance against them Thanksgiving night (236-1-0-35), only five signal-callers have eclipsed the 20-point threshold against them. Overall, QBs are netting a mere 6.68 yards per attempt against San Fran. Specifically, corners Chris Culliver and Perrish Cox, combined, are yielding an impressive 76.4 QB rating on the year. You\'re a master of improvisation and are riding a fiery streak, but this week, champ, you\'ll be instructed to feed the Beast, Marshawn Lynch. '

S"There might have been no bigger Jennings advocate in the preseason than yours truly. If I bumped into him under the mistletoe, I would definitely plant a sloppy smooch. That's how deep my love is. Battling through an ankle injury, Jennings played only sparingly last week against Tennessee. Netting just 18 snaps, he totaled an unavailing 23 yards on three touches. It was rookie Andre Williams who inflicted the damage, flattening Titans en route to a banner fantasy day. However, despite the veteran's unproductive afternoon, his cameo was encouraging. So for this week he's practiced in full, a positive sign he'll tote his usual 18-22 touch workload Sunday. Still, it's smart to express apprehension. From top-to-bottom Washington is a broken organization. Santa needs to fill Dan Snyder's stocking with competence. However, the one area the Redskins have excelled in is run defense. Jim Haslett's 3-4 has bottled up several high-profiled backs, including Jennings in Week 4 (14 touches, 52 yards). In total, it's surrendered the fourth-fewest fantasy points to RBs, allowing just 3.79 yards per carry and seven touchdowns in 13 games. Throw in Williams' goal-line poach factor and my summer crush is sure to break hearts. Give me LeGarrette Blount (vs. Mia), Joique Bell (vs. Min) or Latavius Murray (at KC) over him. "

S'Undoubtedly, the plus-sized back, after a horrendous start, has earned his Christmas cookies. Largely due to an oppressive early season slate, he slipped out of the starting block ranking No. 54 in per-game average from Weeks 1-3. Since then Green Bay\'s locomotive has picked up steam. In his last 10 contests, he totaled 4.8 yards per carry and 17.4 fantasy points per game, the sixth-best mark among RBs. The consensus top-five pick, as advertised, has trucked over would-be tacklers. In Marshawn Lynch fashion, he\'s gained nearly 60 percent of his yards after contact. Surprisingly, he\'s also delivered consistent results as a receiver, reeling in close to three catches per game. Point blank, unlike Mark Ingram and Trent Richardson before him, the former \'Bama back has lived up to the mammoth expectations. This week, however, Lacy may be more mouse than mastodon. Limited by a bruised hip he could surrender more touches than usual to James Starks. The matchup, too, is very unappealing. Thanks to a TD hat-trick, C.J. Anderson was a fantasy juggernaut against the Bills last week. On 21 grips, he averaged a ghastly 2.76 yards per carry. Including the Bronco, only four RBs have achieved "Flame" status vs. Buffalo. Overall, the Bills are giving up a lowly 3.76 yards per carry to rushers. Lacy is a rolling block of cheddar, but in light of his injury and based on the opponent, underachievement is very possible. Similar to C.J. last week, he\'ll need a couple wide receiver tackles inside the five to enhance his fantasy totals. '

S'Since his activation three weeks ago, the former automobile salesman has been a real lemon. He burst back on the fantasy scene in Atlanta steering his way to eight catches for 120 yards. Sadly since then, he\'s slammed on the brakes, bottoming out last week catching a measly two passes for 15 yards against the Vontae Davis-less Colts. Explanations ranging from lack of conditioning to questionable route running to poor playbook knowledge have all been bandied about. Thanks for rewarding our patience, Josh. Allegedly, the Browns were considering a workload reduction entering last Sunday, but his 54-of-68 snaps seen in Week 14 implies that idea was pure poppycock. Now enters the great unknown, Johnny Manziel. Though I sincerely believe the "midget" will eventually silence his critics, his first task is a tall one. Cincinnati, which has allowed a league-low 14 passing touchdowns, is no patsy when it comes to pass defense. Corner Terrance Newman has yielded just 9.8 yards per catch. On the year, only seven WRs have notched 10-plus points against the Bengals. Another eight-plus targets are in order and Manziel is a more accurate passer than Brian Hoyer, but given the opponent and entire situation, the Brown likely whimpers. '

S"Sometimes guys simply have your number. That's certainly the case for Green when it comes to Joe Haden. The Cleveland corner is very familiar with the All-Pro. He understands his strengths, weaknesses and general tendencies. As a result, Green has TOTALED 13 receptions for 81 yards and no scores against him in their past three clashes. Overall, the receiver has averaged an underwhelming 60.7 yards per game in seven career Buckeye State battles. Horse tranquilizers couldn't have stopped Green last week against Pittsburgh. On 15 targets, he hauled in 11 receptions for a career-best 224 yards. But the Haden history, coupled with the DB's recent sensational play (43.1 catch percentage, 46.8 QB rating allowed since Week 9), should understandably raise owner concern. The guy has stuck to assignments like ineptitude to the Jets. Given the scouting report, it's entirely conceivable Mike Evans (at Car), Kenny Stills (at Chi) or even Jordan Matthews (vs. Dal) outpace him. "

S"Stafford is one stuffing-filled backside shy of being a certifiable turkey. The fantasy gobbler has once again fallen short of my mammoth expectations, rendering this bold preseason prediction a painful reminder of my general incompetence. Back in August, everything seemed to be coming into focus for the QB. Already blessed with arguably the league's best arsenal spearheaded by Calvin Johnson and Golden Tate and sporting refined mechanics, he was expected to pay monster dividends in a Joe Lombardi offense fashioned after the New Orleans Saints. Sadly, he's paid only cents on the dollar. His 16.1 fantasy points per game ranks No. 22 among signal-callers. His stunning imprecision (No. 22 in accuracy percentage) in a system predicated on high-percentage throws is downright baffling. Though he's on pace for another 600-plus attempts, it seems, no matter how ridiculous the volume, he will never return to the elite producer he was in 2011. Glancing at the numbers, he's essentially Derek Carr with two more rushing touchdowns. Yuck. Despite his terribly bland profile and eroding owner confidence, Stafford is someone to trust in Week 13. In four career Turkey Day showdowns, he's averaged 315 passing yards per game and totaled seven touchdowns. In this week's holiday classic, Chicago provides the perfect side dish. The Bears secondary, one of the most giving in the league, has surrendered 287.4 passing yards and 2.8 passing touchdowns per game since Week 4. Against an undersized Tim Jennings (5-foot-8), Stafford and Megatron play pitch and catch. Dig in. "

S"A can of beer in an otherwise empty fridge, Murray was finally cracked open last week against Kansas City. For those who gambled on his services, the sophomore back went down smooth, very smooth. Based on his first carry and prior showing in San Diego (7-59-0), it was obvious to everyone the 6-foot-3, 225-pound athletic marvel with 4.38 40-yard wheels offered exponentially more upside than fossilized vets Darren McFadden and Maurice Jones-Drew. Though his night ended way too quickly, his decisiveness, open-field explosion and versatility were clearly on display. His 4-112-2 final line was the definition of efficient. Murray did suffer a nasty concussion, reportedly the first of his football-playing career, but the setback shouldn't derail him in St. Louis. After last week's showing, Tony Sparano would be bat-(expletive) crazy not to feed Murray the rock at least 15 times. Seriously, what do the Raiders have to play for? The Rams have defended the run well, conceding only 3.83 yards per carry to RBs. However, they were shoved around by a makeshift Chargers offensive line in Week 12, giving up over 100 yards to Ryan Mathews on just 12 carries. Yes, Oakland's line would probably find moving a futon difficult, but the kid's talents alone should land him inside the RB top-24. "

S"After last week's relentless snowfall, I thought the entire Bills team would need Tauntauns to escape Buffalo. However, making it to Detroit safely, Jackson and cohorts took out their week-long frustrations, flattening the Jets from start to finish. The hardened veteran looked wooden on his 12 carries grinding his way to just 32 yards. However, he powered into the end zone for a 5-yard score and sweetened the deal for PPR zealots catching three passes for 13 yards. Still rounding into form after missing multiple games with a groin injury, he isn't quite back to full strength, meaning Boobie Dixon and Bryce Brown will remain heavily involved. Still, another 14-17 touches are in order for F-Jax this week. Cleveland, which has conceded 4.38 yards per carry, is an exploitable defense. In total, seven rushers have notched at least 13 fantasy points against the Browns. And many of those standout performances were with Phil Taylor, who is on IR with a knee injury, on the field. Presumably back at Ralph Wilson Stadium, the distinguished rusher is a strong bet to penetrate the RB2 class. "

S'Next to Chris Bosh, there is no neck in professional sports longer than Floyd\'s. Ostriches find it intimidating. His outstretched head connector makes up a lengthy frame, one that\'s frequently given defenders fits this season. His 16.8 yards per catch is top-10 among qualified receivers. Ranked No. 38 in WR per game average, he\'s been rather hit or miss. However, this week\'s road clash with Baltimore presents a unique opportunity. The Ravens, without Jimmy Smith, have been clipped often downfield. No purple-clad corner ranks inside the top-80 in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus. Overall, Baltimore has surrendered the third-most fantasy points to the position. It also ranks top-10 in most pass plays of 20-plus yards allowed. Provided San Diego\'s patchwork offensive line awards Philip Rivers ample time, Floyd should haul in a long bomb or three against LarDarius Webb and friends. His fifth "Flame" worthy effort of the season is on the horizon.  '

S"Buttery mashed potatoes, fresh-baked biscuits, moist stuffing, velvety gravy -- most have an uncountable number of options at the dinner table on Thanksgiving Day. But one underrated turkey complement, the green bean casserole, shouldn't be overlooked. Neither should Hawkins. Like the delectable dish, the Browns wideout isn't one to pass over. Owned in just 37 percent of Yahoo leagues, he typically is. Touchdowns have been few and far between, but he's still on pace for a highly employable 80 receptions and 1,110 yards. Wide open on several occasions in Atlanta last week (Tally: 5-5-93-0), he should continue to benefit greatly from Josh Gordon's on-field presence. His precise routes, quick breaks and overall shiftiness underneath will hurt defenses. Gone are his days of 10-plus targets, but on roughly 6-8 looks per game he should inflict heavy damage, especially this week. Down Leodis McKelvin, the Bills' already vulnerable secondary is only weaker. It shined Monday in Detroit, but much of that was due to the Jets' nonexistent execution. Provided Mother Nature doesn't unleash hell again on Western New York between now and Sunday, bank on Baby Hawk soaring once again in PPR. "

S'Pour one out for Reggie Wayne. According to local reports, the future HOFer might be nearing the end of the road. The decorated wideout is clearly slowing down. At 36, his separation skills and overall reliability are fading. Last week against Jacksonville, for example, he grabbed just three passes (on nine targets) for 10 yards. Since Week 8, he\'s crossed the chalk only once and averaged a pedestrian four receptions and 44.2 yards per game. Yippee. Moncrief, who proved earlier this season in Pittsburgh he\'s capable of handling a sizable workload (12-7-112-1), is a star in the making. He hasn\'t made a deep impact like other first-year targets (e.g. Sammy Watkins, Kelvin Benjamin, Mike Evans, and Odell Beckham Jr.), but he certainly possesses the physical attributes, press-breaking strength and speed to develop into a high-end WR2, especially in Indy\'s VERY friendly system. Last week he saw action on 30-of-76 snaps, his highest yield since Week 8. Gifted a generous matchup vs. a Washington secondary that\'s allowed 13 "Flame" level wide receivers in 11 games, the rookie could supplant Wayne permanently as early as this week. Redskins starting corners David Amerson and Bashaud Breeland have given up a combined 68.9 catch rate and 108.1 QB rating. Deep leaguers looking for a home run at WR3 should seriously debate his services. '

S"Whether it's the long flight, hard hotel beds or Nyquil hangovers, something has transformed Brees into a road wimp in recent years. Away from the creature comforts of the Superdome, the passer has regressed. In his past 17 road contests, a span stretching back to 2012 and including the playoffs, he's failed to eclipse the 20-fantasy-point mark in Yahoo default leagues an astonishing 11 times. No matter the venue, Brees hasn't measured up this season. Drafted closely behind Peyton Manning, he ranks just outside the top-five on a per-game basis and is on pace for his lowest TD output since 2007 (32). He obviously isn't a Matthew Stafford-level bust, but many novices and experts alike expected more. The Steelers aren't the invincible Steel Curtain of years past. Injuries and advanced age have made them vulnerable in certain areas, particularly containing the run. Still, the Pittsburgh D, like its ageless leader Dick LeBeau, has proved resilient as the season has worn on, excelling at times defending the pass. Only five quarterbacks have crossed the 20-point threshold against it. Credit William Gay. The corner has allowed a 51.5 catch rate to his assignments and ranks No. 19 in pass coverage per Pro Football Focus. It's rare for Brees to finish outside the top-10 any given week, but considering the circumstances the fantasy Saint could turn sinner. It would be no surprise if Ryan Tannehill (at NYJ), Mark Sanchez (at Dal) and on-field counterpart, Ben Roethlisberger (vs. NO), outscore him. "

S'Gather around friends. Gore\'s virtual game self will soon be laid to rest. In a vegetable state since Week 6, San Fran\'s trusty rock is declining rapidly. At times, he\'s resembled the tackle-breaking beast of yesteryear. However, his 3.39 yards per carry and drudging RB39 rank in his past six games doesn\'t have his owners dancing in the streets. Despite his precipitous drop-off, it\'s bewildering why he\'s continuously counted on. When it comes to run-blocking, the Niners O-line is still one of the league\'s best (Ranked No. 3 according to PFF), but Colin Kaepernick\'s glaring inconsistencies have stalled the offense, leading defenses to stack the box. Gore will flash vintage form on occasion, but, if I were Jim Harbaugh, Carlos Hyde would be my featured runner moving forward. The rookie, who\'s gained an impressive 67 percent of his yards after contact, is more explosive, more powerful and more versatile than his venerated teammate. Because of Harbaugh\'s stubbornness, it\'s doubtful the torch will be passed anytime soon. However, if Gore plods his way to minimal gains this week against Seattle, Hyde could start chipping away at his workload. The \'Hawks have given up 4.59 yards per carry since losing premier run-stopper Brandon Membane to injury in Week 10. Still, only three RBs have achieved "Flame" status against them this year (DeMarco Murray, Tre Mason and Jamaal Charles). In a game sure to be dominated by defense and kickers, Gore "The Snore" sleepwalks his way through another week. '

S'T-Pain, presumably afflicted with a nasty case of suckitis, surrendered the start last week to up-and-comer Boom Herron. Though out-snapped 42-33, the ex-Buckeye was far more effective than the veteran, topping Richardson 96-to-42 in total yardage. Richardson, once dubbed a "rolling ball of butcher knives" by Chuck Pagano, couldn\'t cut through a stick of room-temperature butter. To his credit, the former Alabama slammer has gained 70.6 percent of his yards after contact, but he\'s looked to truck defenders, which has rarely happened, instead of eluding them. It\'s no wonder why he\'s registered 1-yard or less on exactly one-third of his carries. Point blank, my cataract-laden terrier has better vision than Richardson. He is expected to trot out with the first team this week against Washington, but he would need to find the end zone multiple times to warrant serious RB2 consideration, an unlikely outcome. The \'Skins have conceded just 3.64 yards per carry to RBs. Yes, Washington\'s horrendous pass coverage should allow the Colts to set up shop often inside the red zone, but there\'s no guarantee Richardson will tote the rock in those situations. I would rather camp outside Wal-Mart in freezing temperatures for a $2 waffle iron than put my playoff hopes on the line with him. Recent waiver sensations C.J. Anderson (at KC), Latavius Murray (at StL) and LeGarrette Blount (at GB) are better options. '

S"Watching Matt Ryan zero in on Roddy White often this season has likely made Jones owners' stomachs churn. The prized receiver, drafted well-inside the position's top-10, hasn't profited. Though he tallied a tidy line in Week 12 (5-68-1), his seven-game touchdown drought leading up to last week explains why he's been more high-end WR2 than sure-fire WR1. His eight dropped passes, the fourth most in the league, along with Ryan's inefficiencies, especially on the road, are also to blame. Arizona was a highly beatable defense over the season's first half. From Weeks 1-8, only Tampa offered a better matchup to wide receivers. However, since then, the Desert Birds have blanketed the competition. Antonio Cromartie and Patrick Peterson have yielded a combined 41.2 catch percentage and 29.2 QB rating to their assignments. Lock. Down. Collectively, the Cards have allowed the fewest fantasy points to WRs in their last four. Jones is a special talent, but against a white-hot secondary, I'm betting he backtracks. "

S"My distant cousin has thrown supporters on his shoulders and willed them to the fantasy playoffs. A bulletproof late-season monster, he's established a seemingly unbreakable bond with Josh McCown. Since Week 9, he's connected with the QB 24 times for 505 yards and six touchdowns. His resulting 21.6 points per game average has outpaced second-best WR, Dez Bryant, by a full three points per game during that stretch. Mike, we peons aren't worthy. No doubt, his lengthy frame, deceptive speed and refined route-running have launched him into the stratosphere. However, he accomplished those numbers against largely soft secondaries (Cle, Atl, Was and Chi). Against a more formidable foe, a brief lapse is possible. It's uncommon for Cincinnati to surrender big gainers downfield. On the year, the Bengals have given up the fourth-fewest pass plays of 20-plus yards. Terrance Newman, once a highly torchable DB in Dallas, has allowed just 8.7 yards per catch this season. Meanwhile, his tag-team partners, Adam Jones and Leon Hall, have yielded a combined 11.5 yards per catch. Evans is on a legendary run, but this week, a healthy serving of stuffing could be on the menu. "

S"It's been summer of highs for Wilson. Nearly flawless, he was Energy Star certified in preseason play. Super efficient, judicious and accurate, he completed 33 of 42 passes for 437 yards and three touchdowns (zero INTs). He's yet to surpass the 30-score threshold in two years, but he should flirt with the achievement this season. Yes, the 'Hawks, supported by their suffocating defense, will again emphasize ball control, however, with a full season of Percy Harvin (we hope) and an emerging big-play weapon in Jermaine Kearse, it's possible the passer posts career benchmarks across the board. His quest begins Thursday night against Green Bay. The Packers' D, hampered by injuries (Clay Matthews) and poor play last season, hopes to tighten the screws. Unfortunately, offseason acquisition Julius Peppers is not the game-changing player he was earlier in his career and sans interior lineman B.J. Raji, question marks are aplenty. Throw in the below average execution of corners Sam Shields and Tramon Williams throughout August, and odds are strong Wilson showcases a fiery hand in the opener. Count on him for QB1 numbers in 12-team leagues. "

S'Most would agree, similar to New Orleans or even Tennessee, the backfield division in Foxboro is wildly unpredictable and nearly impossible to forecast. Ah the joys of Bill Belichick. However, the situation might be clearer than you think. Notorious fumbler Stevan Ridley played sparingly throughout the preseason and rookie James White, who rotated in occasionally with the ones, accomplished little with his opportunities. Enter Vereen. If his role and resulting output two weeks ago versus Carolina was an indication of what\'s to come (11 touches, 75 total yards, 2 TDs), he will be a cherished RB2 this season. He will occasionally surrender interior carries to Ridley, White and possibly Brandon Bolden, but it appears likely he will play at least 60 percent of the team\'s snaps, if not more. As Pats beat writer Mike Reiss recently reported, Vereen will have a "significant role in almost any plan." Bank on that being the case in Miami. With Rob Gronkowski expected to play in a limited capacity, the Swiss Army Knife should terrorize a banged up Dolphins linebacker corps, a group that conceded nearly five receptions per game to rushers last year. No matter the format, trust Vereen to record top-10 numbers on roughly 15-18 touches. '

S'There are certain things in sports that can\'t be unseen. Joe Theisman\'s broken leg, Justin Verlander\'s uncovered backside and Cleveland\'s passing offense instantly come to mind. Though the Browns are clearly a work in progress vertically, the ground game is a bit more refined. In Kyle Shanahan\'s zone-blocking scheme, they should be one of the better run-it-down-your-throat teams. The first-string offensive line, anchored by Joe Thomas and Alex Mack, graded out as the fourth-best run-blocking unit in exhibition play according to Pro Football Focus. Tate, who completely outplayed rookie Terrance West this summer, is solidified as the club\'s primary workhorse. As reported by the Akron Beacon Journal over the holiday weekend, Mike Pettine admitted he\'s "comfortable" with the veteran toting a three-down workload. The anticipated RBBC is dead, at least for now. Once a feared D, the "Soft Curtain" is a shell of its former self. Gashed often in the preseason, Steelers defenders were routinely out of position, surrendering numerous explosive plays. Rashad Jennings\' 73-yard end-zone sprint three weeks ago exhibited their vulnerability. Yes, a hard sneeze could sideline Tate, but healthy for now, the rusher is a top-shelf RB2 who could pack serious bite on 20-plus touches.'

S'Rookie. First game. Division rival. That setup would scare off many. However, the Mario Batali of fantasy wideouts is about to torch the Falcons like a creme brulee. Whether on short screens, simple curls or returns, Cooks put up highlight plays throughout August. His 4.33 40-yard speed, Sproles-like elusiveness and unfazed attitude fostered many a man-crush. Drew Brees was just one guy who fell head over heels. There are many mouths to feed in the Saints\' socialist offense and it\'s unclear exactly how many snaps he\'ll play, but gut feeling says "Lightning" will strike in Atlanta. Entering the regular season the Falcons\' D, a unit that ranked at or near the bottom in several categories a season ago giving up over 6,000 yards and 430-plus points, looks non-threatening. After losing its leader, Sean Weatherspoon, earlier this summer, it may never recover. Count on Sean Peyton to find creative ways to feed Cooks in space, maximizing his potential. This will be the first of many terrific ROY-caliber performances. '

S"Despite being arguably the most productive receiver in Texans camp, Hopkins wasn't well-received by fanatics. His 125-plus ADP in Yahoo leagues made him a rock-bottom buy, particularly in PPR formats. Andre Johnson is expected to be the main man once again in Houston, but Ryan Fitzpatrick developed a bubbling chemistry with Hopkins during the veteran's self-imposed layoff in OTAs and minicamp. That rapport could mirror what the QB had with Kendall Wright in Tennessee last year. Their established relationship and the sophomore's experience gained after playing over 1,000 snaps last year should pay instant dividends. A breakout campaign is very much in the offing. Washington offered minimal resistance against the pass a season ago, ranking in the bottom 10 in receptions and yards allowed to wide receivers. During the preseason, DeAngelo Hall continued to slack in coverage yielding a 118.8 QB rating. Because Fitzpatrick rarely challenges defenses deep, bank on him nickel and diming Jay Gruden's bunch underneath, an area where Hopkins typically thrives. "

S"Frankie Hammond, Donnie Avery, Junior Hemmingway, A.J. Jenkins \xe2\x80\x93 down Dwayne Bowe (suspension), these are Andy Reid's top options at WR Week 1. Exciting. Unless the early 2000s version of Derrick Alexander or Eddie Kennison walks through the door tomorrow, it seems highly likely Kelce, the club's most athletic and explosive receiving weapon, will be an integral part of the gameplan vs. Tennessee. He played only sparingly with the first team during exhibition action (15 snaps), conceding time to Anthony Fasano, but totaling 11 catches, 193 yards, two scores and nine missed tackles. He's indisputably the Chiefs' finest downfield playmaker. The Titans were routinely burned by oversized targets in zone coverage last season, surrendering 4.8 receptions and 57.7 yards per game to tight ends. Though the defense has transitioned from 4-3 to 3-4 under Ray Horton, it's still an exploitable unit. To take advantage of Kelce's size and speed (4.61 40-yard), look for Reid to shift him around the field with most of his work coming outside or in the slot. Mark my words, he will be arguably THE hottest waiver add come Tuesday morning. "

S"Seismologists in the greater Seattle area better be on standby. The needle is about to go haywire at the Left Coast 'Link.' Without a doubt, Rodgers will challenge Peyton Manning and Drew Brees for head of this year's fantasy QB class. He's an established veteran in a balanced offense who is blessed with ample weapons and a suspect defense. However, the 'always start your studs' theory doesn't apply to Mr. Discount Double-Check this week. Statistically, Seattle is a Bermuda Triangle for visiting teams. Enter the zip code and value vanishes. Stretching back 14 games (Week 6, 2012), no opposing passer has stepped into the Link and posted 20 fantasy points in a game, and that includes Drew Brees' 147-1-0 (7.3 standard points) dud Week 13 last year. The last time Rodgers sloughed into Seattle \xe2\x80\x93 the replacement ref game \xe2\x80\x93 he notched a mere 240 combined yards without a touchdown, an extremely rare flop. How uncommon? He's thrown a touchdown in 15 straight games, including the playoffs, a period going back two years. That streak, though, is in jeopardy. During their title run last year, Richard Sherman and company yielded only 5.8 yards per attempt and three multi-TD performances in the regular season. It's difficult to demote one of your top picks, but don't be surprised if Jay Cutler (vs. Buf), Russell Wilson (vs. GB) and Colin Kaepernick (at Dal) outperform him. "

S"Throughout the 'expert' community, lines in the sand were drawn over Morris. Supporters contended he's a workhorse in a revamped Jay Gruden-run offense that should overwork defenses. On the other side of the coin, naysayers expressed their concerns regarding RGIII, Roy Helu's impact and Morris' possible diminished role at the goal-line, legitimate gripes. No question, the rusher will be a major part of the game-plan in Houston. Up the middle, the Texans have plenty of questions.  Starting nose tackle Jerrell Powe, for example, has played sparingly in his three-year career. Still, J.J. Watt was otherworldly stuffing the run last season and with Brian Cushing back in the fold and Jadeveon Clowney on roster, Houston, which allowed an unintimidating 4.32 yards per carry to RBs in '13, promises to be a significantly improved run defense. Toss in question marks about RGIII's mechanics, the Texans' strong back end and the rusher's lack of versatility, and, suffice it to say, it could be a very vanilla 2014 debut for Alf. Sorry Morris enthusiasts, but 'The Butler' gets served by an above average Texans defense. "

S"To say the least, it's been a summer loaded with psychadellic highs and sobering lows for everyone's favorite 'Sour Diesel.' His toke session with LeGarrette Blount, subsequent DUI and chatter of a full-blown RBBC greatly clouded his prospects. However, when prompted about Bell's Week 1 role earlier this week, head coach Mike Tomlin reiterated the incumbent is still the club's workhorse, potentially logging upwards of 20-25 touches in the opener. After netting 22.2 grips per game last year, Tomlin's words may not be that farfetched. Game flow, though, will ultimately determine the rusher's workload. Don't expect it to unfold in his favor. Pittsburgh's defense looks absolutely dreadful. Even against a sorrowful Cleveland offense, it very easily could relinquish numerous points. Combine that with a rabid Browns' 3-4 D highlighted by maneaters Paul Kruger and Ahytba Rubin, and Bell's chances of finishing inside the RB top-20 aren't especially appreciable. Because he's an exceptional pass catcher, he's still highly employable in PPR settings, just don't expect spectacular results in standard leagues. "

S"Entering his third season, many have placed high expectations on the rollercoaster ride. Believers assert Gary Kubiak's play-action offense will do the receiver wonders. However, projecting impactful performances for the king of inconsistency is an exercise in futility. Last season, he achieved fantasy Flame status (11-plus points) a lowly four times. His big play-dependent nature leads to many inconsequential weeks. Bank on that being this case against division foe Cincinnati. Facing off against the Bengals six times in his career, Smith has compiled lackluster numbers. In those contests, he's found the end-zone twice and averaged 3.5 receptions and 54.7 receiving yards per game. When healthy last year, corner Leon Hall blanketed assignments like few others. He and Terrance Newman conceded a combined 11.5 yards per catch. Because Marvin Lewis typyically takes away the home run by bracketing receivers downfield, it's likely Smith struggles in the opener. Unheralded options Julian Edelman (at Mia), DeAndre Hopkins (vs. Was) and Golden Tate (vs. NYG) are more attractive alternatives. "

S'To Gronk or not to Gronk? That, my fantasy friends, is the fantasy question. If you\'re into jumping out of planes, driving at high speeds or consuming Rocky Mountain oysters, by all means, spin the roulette wheel. If you\'re of a more rational mind, leave the high-priced tight end on the bench. Most will reason if you drafted Gronk in Round 2 or Round 3, he is must-start material no matter the situation. Even on 15-20 snaps, he\'s a strong candidate to cash six. After all, he scored 42 touchdowns in 50 career games. However, as Bill Belichick hinted Tuesday, we have zero clue to what extent he\'ll be used, if at all. It\'s entirely possible he\'ll play the role of decoy, seeing minimal action. Gronk himself said Monday he wants to merely "get (his) feet wet" after a long layoff from reconstructive knee surgery. The Dolphins are an exploitable bunch, but it may take a game or three for the former All-Pro to shake the rust off. Sorry, but #TeamRaisins makes complete sense here. '

S"The last time Younger Manning was advertised in this space, those who bought in probably chucked chicken wings at their television screens in disgust. I hexed the poor dude. Gifted a marvelous matchup against Philly and sporting a hot hand he underperformed, miserably stumbling his way to 151 yards without a touchdown. That, Team Huevos, is why the NFL stands for No Friggin' Logic. Strangely confident he'll right the previous wrong, I'm going back to the Eli well. Fresh off the bye, he should toe the QB1 line. Prior to Ben Roethlisberger's record-setting afternoon, Indy was one of the most feared defenses in Fantasyland. Up until they allowed 522 yards and six touchdowns to Big Ben, the Colts had given up a mere 191.8 passing yards and two touchdowns to QBs in their previous four contests. Vontae Davis' early exit, though, changed the complexity of Greg Manusky's scheme, leaving its participants dazed and thoroughly confused. Davis' MRI came back negative, but he still could miss time. If the corner is unavailable Sunday, a rejuvenated Eli airs it out. "

S"If Shoelace continues to pound the pigskin, he might just earn himself a lucrative sneaker deal. Bulkier, but still lightning quick, the former Michigan QB is developing into a reliable RB2. Earning the start last week over snails Toby Gerhart and Storm Johnson, Robinson bolted his way to 118 combined yards on 19 touches vs. Miami, his second-consecutive 100-yard effort. Fleet-footed, decisive and elusive, he certainly has the look of a near every-down asset moving forward. Under the microscope, advanced metrics convey a slightly different message. His 4.84 yards per carry is stellar, but only 42.8 percent of yards gained have come after contact and he's forced just four missed tackles on 80 touches. Still, the volume remains very attractive. So does his Week 9 matchup. Since Week 3, only the bumbling Bucs have surrendered more fantasy points to rushers than Cincinnati. During that span, the Bengals have allowed a staggering 4.66 yards per carry, 170.4 total yards and seven touchdowns to the position. Geno Atkins still checks out as one of the league's best run defenders, but injuries and inconsistencies at linebacker explain the Bengals' vulnerability to RBs. Game flow is critical for Robinson, but if the rapidly improving Jags D can continue its upward climb, another triple-digit output is likely. "

S'It never ceases to amaze where fantasy value crops up from. Less than three weeks ago, Gray was a nobody on the practice squad, a buried rusher worth about as much as a JaMarcus Russell autograph. However, one devastating Stevan Ridley knee injury later and the former Golden Domer is Bill Belichick\'s latest "big back," a role that suits his skill set perfectly. Gray isn\'t a flashy runner by any means, but his stout 5-foot-10, 225-pound frame and one-cut ability work beautifully in Josh McDaniels\' offense. He sees the hole and attacks it aggressively by getting downhill. Owners didn\'t exactly retire off his 17-86-0 (5.06 ypc) performance last week vs. Chicago, but, for those who play in challenging leagues where Tom Brady wasn\'t considered a preseason "sleeper," it was useful nonetheless. Undoubtedly, Denver is an extremely difficult opponent. The Broncos are tenacious, quick to the ball and generally unyielding. RBs have totaled a mere 2.65 yards per carry and 46.5 rushing yards per game against them. Many would rather hang with Painfully Awkward Rob Lowe than trust a little known RB against a stingy Denver run D, but this promises to be a high-scoring contest. With Brady out of his mind right now, I\'m banking on a goal-to-go opportunity or three for Gray. Debate his services in the FLEX in 12-team leagues.  '

S"Drawing his first start of what could be a spectacular NFL career, Donte resembled another Moncrief, former NBA great Sidney. Save for a couple of drops, the rookie was flat out smooth. Against the Steelers he grabbed seven passes (on 12 targets) for 113 yards and a touchdown, routinely using his sinewy 6-foot-2, 225-pound frame and physical off-the-line nature to gain separation. According to Indy Star contributor Stephen Holder, the Colts are optimistic Reggie Wayne will return to action this week after sitting Week 8 with an elbow injury. Even if he returns, Moncrief should play a substantial role. The youngster is simply too good to be utilized in a limited capacity. Another 35-plus snaps are completely realistic. Spearheaded by Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and Prince Amukamura, the Giants secondary has performed admirably this year. Combined they've conceded a 53.8 catch rate and 65.7 QB rating. Overall, only five wide receivers have reached the 60-yard mark against New York. Though the paper matchup is unappealing, Moncrief's imposing stature and veteran-like approach should win the day. In a brutal bye week, he's a highly employable WR3. "

S"Kelce is a swinging pendulum personified. Thanks to Andy Reid's insistence on limiting him to 50-60 percent of team snaps, the tight end has been wildly inconsistent. On fire from Weeks 3-5, he racked the fifth-best line at the position, catching 13 passes for 144 yards and three touchdowns. Since then, however, he's grabbed just eight balls for 78 yards and no scores. But this week presents a unique opportunity. The one-win Jets are lousy in all facets of the game, particularly containing plus-sized targets. Linebackers DeMario Davis and David Harris have allowed 40 receptions on 51 targets (78.4 catch percentage). And no defense has surrendered more TDs (9) to the position over the past six weeks. Alex Smith is sure to play it conservative, but of his roughly 25-30 pass attempts, 7-8 will be thrown No. 87's way. This is the week Special K once again cracks the TE top-10. "

S'If Doug Martin were a Halloween candy, he would definitely be a butterscotch-flavored Dum-Dums pop. The man doesn\'t exactly stimulate the taste buds. Rumored to be on the trade block and now dealing with an ankle injury, the "Muscle Hamster" may soon be snake food. Advantage Rainey. Over the past week, much has been said about Charles Sims\' imminent return and possible rest-of-season impact. An ESPN report suggested Sims could earn "serious carries" down the homestretch, but the fact of the matter is the rookie back hasn\'t logged a single snap this season. It\'s entirely plausible he\'s eased into a 12-14 touch workload over the next couple weeks, making Rainey the presumed starter. It\'s difficult for fanatics to erase his two-fumble catastrophe in Atlanta a few weeks back. That\'s understandable. Still, when given opportunities, Rainey has been the Bucs\' most effective back. He\'s averaged 4.6 yards per carry and tallied the second-highest elusive rating of any NFL rusher. His outstanding versatility, shiftiness and surprising brawn cannot be overstated. Blessed with a fabulous matchup against a Browns defense that\'s allowed 4.69 yards per carry and the seventh-most fantasy points to RBs, the veteran, and not Sims, is the Tampa back to trust. '

S"Evident in his steady production the past two seasons, gum-flapping isn't the only area The Bolo Tie excels in. Terribly undervalued on draft day, Rivers has again raged this year. His 21.3 fantasy points per game mark in standard Yahoo leagues ranks No. 5 at the position. He's also on pace for a career-best 40 touchdown passes. From a secondary perspective, the veteran has been every bit as good as his superficial numbers suggest. He ranks top-10 in accuracy percentage and deep-ball passing. Cool under pressure, he's spread the ball around masterfully, rekindling the magic with Antonio Gates while jump-starting Branden Oliver's career. No doubt he's been marvelous, but this week's cross-country trip to Miami poses a problem. The Dolphins secondary is terribly underrated. Brent Grimes and Cortland Finnegan, who both rank inside the top-30 in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus, have given up a combined 10.5 yards per catch. Collectively, the 'Fins D has conceded 6.08 yards per attempt and only a pair of multi-TD passers. This week, Rivers suffers on South Beach. "

S"In an otherwise tumultuous year for Minnesota, the organization has found a real diamond-in-the-rough in McKinnon. The former Georgia Southern quarterback is a star in the making. His unreal athleticism, slashing style, developing versatility, power and explosiveness are Pro Bowl-caliber attributes. On 76 totes, he's blasted his way to 5.16 yards per carry, gaining 56.6 percent of his yards after contact. Matt Asiata, a superior pass-blocker, will continue to wrest away roughly 20-25 snaps per game, but, make no mistake, McKinnon is the club's running back of the future. His long-term upside is blindingly bright, but after disappointing somewhat last week against a soft Tampa D (82 total yards, zero touchdowns), he isn't the strongest play vs. a much stiffer Washington unit. DeMarco Murray went nuts against the 'Skins Monday night, but he was only the second 70-plus yard rusher they had allowed this season. Including the dynamite showing, rushers have managed just 3.93 yards per carry against Jim Haslett's bunch. The 'Skins, riding high after last week's stunning win in Dallas, will feel all warm and fuzzy inside in chilly Minnesota. "

S"The first highly sought after waiver wire acquisition this year has left his investors in the black. In eight games, he's logged the 14th-best line among fantasy running backs, outpacing the likes of early-round selections Eddie Lacy, LeSean McCoy and Alfred Morris. At 5-foot-8, 187-pounds, Forsett is like Scrappy Doo, diminutive yet fearless. He's averaged a ghastly 2.3 yards per carry on runs up the gut, but his 6.5 ypc on off-tackle bursts proves his explosiveness on the edge. An equally dynamic receiver, he's truly been a blessing in disguise in light of the Ray Rice fallout. Still, because of his ineffectiveness in short-yardage, his overall fantasy impact is somewhat stunted. Lorenzo Taliaferro, who punched in a pair of scores inside the 10 last week, should continue to play the role of goal-line gremlin. The last time Forsett faced the Steelers, back in Week 2, he tallied a useful 72 combined yards. Since then, however, Pittsburgh has tightened up its run D. Mike Tomlin's group has yielded a modest 4.03 yards per carry to RBs in their past six games. During that span only Arian Foster and Ahmad Bradshaw exceeded 80 total yards against them. In what will likely be another scratch-and-claw affair in this storied rivalry, Forsett, who isn't close to 100 percent due to an ankle injury, compiles just average numbers. "

S"Trapped on planet Suckitune over the past several weeks, Edelman has contributed little to the virtual game. His 33-291-0 output over New England's past six contests ranks No. 69 among fantasy wideouts, behind such world beaters as Kenny Britt, Taylor Gabriel and Jarvis Landry. The lack of production is especially jarring considering the torrid tour Tom Brady has been on. With the exception of Week 8, Edelman has consistently attracted 8-10 targets per game. However, because of his short-gain nature, Rob Gronkowski's presence and Brandon LaFell's expanded workload, he's essentially become a bit player in a burgeoning offense. His six dropped passes, the second-most in the league, also haven't helped. Though points should be plentiful with Denver coming to town, Edelman is untrustworthy. Broncos Chris Harris and Aqib Talib have bucked assignments regularly this year. Only three wide receivers have exceeded 60 yards against them. Collectively, Denver has given up the eighth-fewest fantasy points to the position. In a brutal bye week, he's still employable as a WR3 in PPR settings, but debating alternatives in standard leagues is recommended. "

S'A fantasy vampire in Week 8, Floyd drained the life out of his owners in what was an incredibly favorable matchup vs. Philly. He was targeted deep four times in that contest, but botched a pair of opportunities on catchable balls. His resulting triple-bagel (0-0-0) left owners greatly perturbed. Overall, Floyd has been a monumental disappointment. Tabbed as a strong breakout candidate by several pundits, he\'s been a king of inconsistency. On pace for a mere 43 catches, 805 yards and four touchdowns, he\'s really nothing more than a WR5 in 12-team leagues. Dallas made Colt McCoy look like Mark Rypien circa \'91 last Monday as the ex-Longhorn connected with DeSean Jackson on numerous explosive pass plays. Still, the strength of the Cowboys defense is its secondary. Orlando Scandrick and friends have surrendered the fourth-fewest pass plays of 20-plus yards. Because Floyd typically earns his paycheck hauling in long throws, he could again confound his supporters. Without a 50-yard game to his name since Week 3, the Cardinal "pulls a Canseco" in Big D. '

S'True story. Several weeks ago while aimlessly walking the streets of Las Vegas, I popped into the Hard Rock Hotel\'s sportsbook to peruse Super Bowl odds. The usual suspects, Denver, Seattle and Green Bay were heavy favorites, unattractive options for individuals looking to score a windfall. However, one team, Arizona, listed at 42:1, caught my eye. Off a 10-win campaign and loaded with talent on both sides, I glanced at the number, briefly debated and promptly plopped down a crisp Andy Jackson on the Cards to take the whole enchilada. Ten weeks later, Arizona, largely due to Palmer\'s brilliant play, is the best team in the NFL at 7-1. Unreal. Despite losing Darnell Docket and Calais Campbell to injury, the "Red Storm" defense has lived up to its moniker. However, it\'s the offense, spearheaded by a 35-year-old QB whose season hung in the balance just weeks ago due to a painful nerve condition impacting his shoulder, that has the Desert Birds flying high. Head-scratchingly disrespected in fantasy circles, Palmer has tossed at least two touchdowns in every start. His 20.0 points per game output ranks No. 9, ahead of starting staples Philip Rivers, Matt Ryan and Matthew Stafford. Under pressure just 33.3 percent of the time (down from 40.3 in \'13), he\'s picked apart the opposition short and especially long. His 50.0 accuracy percentage on throws beyond 20 yards ranks No. 7 among QBs. The Rams, for the most part, have been abysmal in coverage. Four quarterbacks in their last seven contests have scored at least 20 fantasy points against them. Possibly down Janoris Jenkins another week, they remain ripe for the picking. '

S'Unleashed against the Jags, Hill shook off a brief knee injury and bulled his way to an eye-popping 154 rushing yards and a pair of scores on 24 carries. Reduced to a secondary role behind Gio Bernard, the youngster from LSU has only occasionally flashed the vision, versatility and brutalizing power that invoked many to spend a handsome draft pick on the kid back in August. But the promise he delivered on Sunday was all that and a bag of Doritos. Some will lower expectations for the rookie given the short week, but don\'t buy into their blindness. Because he was used only sparingly leading up to last week\'s coming out party, his legs are farm-to-table fresh. Most encouragingly, whispers out of the Queen City suggest Bernard\'s odds of returning are rather small. Another hefty workload could be in the offing for Hill. Good times. The Browns have packed little bite against the run. On the year, they\'ve given up 4.62 yards per carry and 157.5 total yards per game to RBs. Overall, eight rushers have scored at least 13 fantasy points in the "Flames" format against them. Hill, likely sans Bernard, will add to his Mark Ingram-like midseason run. '

S'Jackson\'s existence might possibly predate the Egyptian pyramids. At 31 and with "a mere" 3,098 career touches to his name, he\'s an antique. No doubt, his advanced age has slowed him down. On a light 13.1 touches per game, the former rush king has managed just 3.63 yards per carry in eight games. Why then feature him on this list? It might sound cliche, but fantasy is entirely a game of matchups and Jackson is blessed with one of the finest in the land. Someone has stolen the Buccaneers\' booty. A feared defense led by the likes of Warren Sapp and Simeon Rice roughly a decade ago, they\'ve become a depressing ragtag bunch. To be fair, Tampa has surrendered a laudable 3.87 yards per carry to RBs, but routinely playing from behind, it\'s been swarmed under by persistent volume. Teams are netting nearly 27 rush attempts per game against the Bucs. Overall, they\'ve allowed the 10th-most fantasy points to RBs. Jackson sloughed his way to 54 yards and a TD in the first clash back in Week 3. Fresh off a long bye, he bests that line in the follow-up. Consider him a back-end RB2 with upside, albeit marginal, in 12-team leagues. '

S"Ben Roethlisberger's record-smashing 12 touchdown passes over the past two weeks must have Steelers zealot Snoop Dogg/Lion on the highest of highs. Oooo-eeee! One of the primary reasons for Big Ben's sudden eruption is unequivocally Bryant. Routinely inactive over the regular season's first half, the Clemson product has quickly developed into a TD tour de force. His five scores in his first three games has been duplicated by only Eric Green, another Steeler, in the NFL's 90-plus year history. His lanky 6-foot-4 frame and drag racer speed (4.42-yard dash) pose serious problems for defenders. The extra step he gains, in similar fashion as Cleveland's Josh Gordon, is downright deadly, particularly when working in conjunction with a terrific deep-ball quarterback. This week his scoring streak should continue against the funny bad Jets. Corners Antonio Allen and Darrin Walls continue to stake their claim as the worst coverage combo in the league. In total, they've surrendered 14.9 yards per catch and a 128.8 QB rating, rotten production which explains why they rank outside the top-70 in pass coverage among CBs according to Pro Football Focus. Bryant, now must-start material, is a viable WR2 in 10-team leagues. "

S"The forgotten man in a loaded Packers offense, Adams, yet another rookie WR making waves in his inaugural season, is rapidly gaining traction. His yardage contributions have been a bit erratic, but with a pair of touchdowns and two 75-plus yard games to his name over his past four, he\xe2\x80\x99s offered borderline WR3 value in 12-team leagues. Most importantly, he's played on 84 percent of Green Bay's snaps during that span. With defenses exhausting resources to contain Jordy Nelson, Randall Cobb and Eddie Lacy, the youngster should continue to benefit from single coverage, drawing the eye of Aaron Rodgers downfield. Down several key players on defense, the Bears are hardly ferocious. When not physically limited, Kyle Fuller has played exceptionally well. Tim Jennings, however, not so much (63.6 catch rate and 110.2 QB rating allowed). In a contest with plenty of shootout appeal (53 over/under in Vegas), Adams, who should clean up in the short field, is an employable WR3 in 12-team leagues. "

S'Given his spread-it-around nature, when Drew Brees plays roulette he always places stacks on multiple numbers. However, based on his recent tendencies, he\'s opted to invest consistently and sometimes heavily in No. 84. Stills, a lost extra from the Mad Max films, has seen an uptick in targets of late. Over the past three weeks, he\'s garnered 17 looks from Brees, catching 14 balls for 232 yards and a touchdown. His subsequent No. 23 ranking among wide receivers during that span is certainly attention-grabbing. His effort this week could be too. San Fran\'s strength is clearly in the trenches, but it\'s far from restrictive on the back end. In total, 10 wideouts have scored at least 11 fantasy points in the "Flames" format against the Niners. Digging deeper, Perrish Cox has locked down yielding only a 48.9 catch rate to his assignments, but Chris Culliver and Jimmie Ward have given up a combined 110.4 QB rating. Back in the bayou, an environment where the New Orleans offense is typically unstoppable, Stills delivers a strong WR3 line. '

S"Broken. Fractured. Displaced. No matter how one describes it, the Niners, a popular expert playoff pick not long ao, are a team in disarray. The Halloween hangover they experienced last week against the basement-dwelling Rams, post-bye mind you, was nothing short of jaw-dropping. They were unorganized, unprepared and ineffective. Swarmed under a whopping eight times by the St. Louis pass rush, Kaepernick was a deer in headlights, a remarkable turn of events when just three weeks prior he ripped the Rams for a season-best 343 yards and three touchdowns. His uneventful 237-1-0-15 line finished No. 19 among Week 9 QBs. Kaep has performed well in several categories this season, most notably ranking inside the top-12 in deep-ball passing and accuracy percentage. Sadly, though, his QB14 rank hasn't entirely moved the meter. His paper matchup this week is favorable. According to Pro Football Focus, the Saints check in at No. 27 in pass coverage. However, evident in their efforts against Cam Newon in Week 9, they've made strides. And you know in light of Kaepernick folding under the pressure last Sunday, Rob Ryan will bring the house with regularity. Tread lightly. "

S"Listing the JC of KC in this space may seem blasphemous, but the chances of him posting unexceptional numbers are considerable. Unlike many exorbitant RBs, Charles has actually kept his owners afloat. While he does have a rather lowly 78.5 total yards per game average, primarily due to a shrunken role in the pass game, crossing the chalk with regularity (seven times in his last five games) has helped him maintain a RB1 profile. He's No. 10 at the position with 16.3 PPR points per game. Still, big gainers have been few and far between, evident in his 21.5 breakaway percentage (No. 21 among RBs). Blame the rebuilt offensive line. The Chiefs are the fourth-worst run-blocking unit in the NFL according to Pro Football Focus. No longer bumbling, the once overly generous Bills run defense has tightened significantly. Nearly impregnable, Kyle Williams and company have given up just 3.27 yards per carry to rushers. Only three rushers have crossed the 10-fantasy-point threshold against them this year. Charles will receive his usual 18-22 touches, but expect only modest results. "

S"For the better part of the last two seasons, several fantasy owners have waited on pins and needles for Miller to deliver on his RB2 promise. This year, they got their wish. Without much fanfare, the ex-Hurricane has blown through opponents, drowning the competition in a sea of fantasy points. Benefiting from Knowshon Moreno's absence, he's rolled up 4.89 yards per carry, contributed meaningful stats in the pass game (21-158-1) and forced the same number of missed tackles (17) as juke artist Giovani Bernard. His subsequent 15.4 points per game in PPR leagues ranks No. 11, greatly outpacing the likes of first-rounders Eddie Lacy and LeSean McCoy. Miller is dealing with a mild AC sprain in his shoulder, but indications suggest he will be available in Detroit. Dinged wing or not, he isn't the strongest option when weighing the matchup. A well-behaved Ndamukong Suh has routinely munched on running backs. His 16 stops rank near the top of the league among defensive tackles. Collectively, Detroit has allowed a mere 3.15 yards per carry to RBs. Chris Ivory is the only rusher to surpass 65 yards on the ground against the unit. Because the Lions are susceptible in the short field, Miller should post useful numbers in PPR settings. Still, don't anticipate stately production in standard leagues. "

S"Golf outings, shuffleboard sessions and bridge games were at the forefront of the elderly receiver's mind just months ago. Released by Carolina, he debated whether or not to call it quits. But a phone call from Ozzie Newsome changed Smith's perspective. The fantasy community is thankful he answered. Chugging medicinal waters from the beer bong of youth, he's rediscovered his Pro Bowl form. Smith's 15.7 per game yield ranks top-16 at the position. However, much of that production came earlier in the season. Over his past three games, he accounted for just 11 catches for 138 yards and zero touchdowns. Another unsatisfactory effort could be in the offing. Fresh off the bye, Tennessee welcomes back corner Coty Sensabaugh. When in uniform he and Jason McCourty have worked well together. Combined they've allowed a respectable 12.6 yards per catch. Overall, only four WRs have found the end zone against the Titans. Smith should post employable numbers in deeper leagues, but another unextraordinary week is likely in standard settings. Given the Titans' shortcomings stopping the run, I expect a heavy dose of Justin Forsett and Lorenzo Taliaferro. "

S"After a thumping of epic proportions in New England, gray skies over Chicago only darkened during the Bears' bye week. Marc Trestman is at a crossroads. Rumors are swirling around the Windy City, the second-year coach's job could be in jeopardy. Oh how quickly perceptions can change. The road to recovery is a bumpy one for the Bears. The Packers, who dispatched their archrival 38-17 in Chicago Week 4, are firing on all cylinders, particularly in the secondary. Calvin Johnson and Brandin Cooks are the only wideouts to total 80 or more yards against them this year. They've also surrendered the fourth-fewest pass plays of 20-plus yards. Jeffery hasn't exactly lived up to the WR1 preseason hype. He ranks No. 20 at the position in per game average, but, much like the Bears as a whole, he's been erratic at times. He totaled 61 yards and a TD in the first matchup, but with CB Sam Shields (55.2 catch percentage allowed) expected back for the Pack and given the tough road environment, he could take a backseat. At some point, Jay Cutler will force feed a grumpy Brandon Marshall, relegating Alshon to a limited role. Gut feeling says this is that week. "

Historically, the Old Gunslinger has thrived under the spotlight. In 55 career primetime clashes, he\xe2\x80\x99s averaged 237.4 yards and 1.6 touchdowns per game. Given all the controversy and concerns that have enveloped No. 4 in recent weeks, you just know he\xe2\x80\x99s on the precipice of a statistical explosion. Love him or hate him, the man has always excelled when confronted with adversity. Week 7 won\xe2\x80\x99t be any different. Medics in Green Bay are in short supply. Several key players on defense could again be sidelined. Cornerback Al Harris\xe2\x80\x99 possible activation and the return of Clay Matthews definitely helps, but this is a unit that has struggled in pass coverage even at full strength. On the year, the Pack has given up 240.2 yards per game and seven touchdowns to passers equal to the seventh-most fantasy points. Favre claimed his enflamed elbow \xe2\x80\x9cfelt great\xe2\x80\x9d after last week\xe2\x80\x99s win versus Dallas. Assuming the pain doesn\xe2\x80\x99t intensify in practice this week, he should operate without inhibition.

In his \xe2\x80\x98Hawks debut last week at Chicago, he totaled 53 yards and a touchdown on 20 touches.

Lynch is \xe2\x80\x9cexcited\xe2\x80\x9d for good reason. This week, look for the Cardinals to be marked by the Beast. To say Arizona has had difficulties stuffing the run is a gross understatement. On the season, Darnell Docket and cohorts have surrendered 4.7 yards per carry, 173 total yards per game and six touchdowns to RBs equal to the fourth-most fantasy points allowed. Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s offensive line is still a work in progress, but against a generous front, it should dominate the interior. Though he\xe2\x80\x99ll cede approximately 8-12 touches to Justin Forsett, the Beast will feast. Deploy Lynch as a RB2 in 10-team and deeper leagues.'

S'Labeling a player who didn\xe2\x80\x99t log a carry a week ago a \xe2\x80\x9cflame\xe2\x80\x9d may seem audacious, but a three-legged mule could rack appreciable numbers on limited touches against the Bills. John Harbaugh clarified earlier this week uncontrollable circumstances, not a pending trade, was the reason why McGahee disappeared last week. Large helpings of Ray Rice were dished out in an attempt to exploit short-field matchups. Though Rice will again shoulder the heavy-side of the split, McGahee should be utilized in some capacity. Even with 10-12 carries, he could inflict significant damage. On the year, only 10.3 percent of runs against the Bills have gone for zero or negative yards, the lowest mark in the league. Buffalo has also yielded 4.8 yards per carry, 159 total yards per game and six scores to rushers equal to the second-most fantasy points allowed. In what could become a lopsided affair, McGahee cleans up in garbage time. Similar to Brandon Jacobs last week, the goal-line vulture is an upside flex play capable of quality RB2 totals in star-thin formats.'

S'The long-bomb specialist has slowly regained his identity from \xe2\x80\x9909, a season in which he was arguably the Saints\xe2\x80\x99 most consistent fantasy producer at wideout. Eased back into full-time duty after undergoing offseason foot surgery, he\xe2\x80\x99s caught eight passes for 128 yards and two scores in his past two games, including two receptions for 35-plus yards. The Browns, bombarded by opponents over the first half of the fantasy regular season, haven\xe2\x80\x99t earned their Snausages in pass defense. Through six games they\xe2\x80\x99ve allowed 19 pass plays of 20-plus yards and the sixth-most fantasy points to receivers. Drew Brees appeared more comfortable in the pocket in Tampa largely due to a resuscitated ground attack sparked by Christopher Ivory. If the rookie can keep Cleveland on its toes, Meachem should attract several one-on-one situations. Ride him as a WR2 in moderately shallow leagues.'

S'The near beheading of DeSean Jackson by human Guillotine Dunta Robinson thrusts Avant into a prominent role. Because he\xe2\x80\x99s an intelligent route runner who typically works underneath, he could become the apple of Kevin Kolb\xe2\x80\x99s eye. His skill set meshes perfectly with Kolb\xe2\x80\x99s strengths. Keep in mind after Jackson groggily walked off the field, the former Wolverine was targeted five times, reeling in all five passes for 62 yards. Tennessee, which leads the NFL in sacks with 24, swarmed the Jags in Monday\xe2\x80\x99s snooze-fest. If they employ similar tactics this week, Kolb and Avant could burn the Titans often in the short-field. Remember, receivers have scored 25 percent above the league average against the Nashville representative this year. Owners hoping to unearth waiver gold should stream the 95-percent available receiver immediately.'

S"With Big Ben back, a wave of \xe2\x80\x9cchunk plays,\xe2\x80\x9d as the tight end describes them, will crash the shores of South Beach. Roethlisberger's ability to spread the wealth stretches defenses to its limit, creating exploitable voids for Miller and Ward in the short-to-intermediate field. Against Cleveland that was clearly on display as the greasemen combined for seven catches, 104 yards and two touchdowns. Another profitable day could be on the horizon, especially for Miller. Miami hasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed a tight end touchdown since Dustin Keller blew up for two scores in Week 3, but as Green Bay\xe2\x80\x99s Tom Crabtree and Andrew Quarless proved a week ago, the \xe2\x80\x98Fins often play loose coverage across the middle. Expect Miller to take advantage. Due to the rash of injuries at the position, he\xe2\x80\x99s easily a top-five play in Week 7."

S'Crayton, who was dealt from Dallas to the San Diego for a seventh-round pick back in early September, has found a new lease on life out West. After the injury imp snacked on Antonio Gates and Malcom Floyd last week in St. Louis, the veteran established an instant bond with Philip Rivers connecting six times for 117 yards. The triple-digit effort was only the fourth of his career. With Floyd hamstrung and possibly minus Legedu Naanee, Crayton could again step to the forefront. Because New England has performed unPatriotically against the pass, Philip Rivers will undoubtedly take to the sky. On the year, Beelzechick\xe2\x80\x99s bunch has allowed the fifth-most fantasy points to wide receivers. Though Crayton doesn\xe2\x80\x99t posses the explosiveness of Floyd, he\xe2\x80\x99s a quick, undaunted wideout who functions smoothly in traffic and down the sidelines (Visual evidence here). With Antonio Gates, who officials feel "optimistic" about playing this week, drawing so much attention between the hashmarks, the receiver could attract a large workload working the peripheries. Plug him in.'

S'Local media might be screaming \xe2\x80\x9cinjustice\xe2\x80\x9d over Brady\xe2\x80\x99s No. 21 ranking of all-time great players by the NFL Network, but this week he\xe2\x80\x99ll look far from legendary. If that happens, we can only hope Justin Bieber goes all Easy E on Goldilocks\xe2\x80\x99 game, not his mane. Despite missing key components on defense (e.g. Shawne Merriman), the Chargers have jolted the competition. Passers have performed 26.3 percent below the league average against them netting a mere 183 yards and 0.75 touchdowns per game. Understandably, doubters will point to a lack of meaningful competition for the inflated numbers. After all, Matt Hasselbeck is the best quarterback San Diego has faced. Cornerback Antoine Cason\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing play last week against St. Louis only increases distrust. Still, at home and with their backs against the wall, the Chargers 3-4 will prove its defensive acuity isn\xe2\x80\x99t a facade (Ok, it\xe2\x80\x99s a stretch, but we have limited options that qualify). Keep in mind Brady has tallied a marginal 15 points per game away from Foxboro this year. Possible QB alternatives: Kyle Orton (vs. Oak), Kevin Kolb (at Ten), Matt Cassel (vs. Jax)'

S'The last time Todd Bouman, who is expected to draw the start with David Garrard and Trent Edwards sidelined, placed his hands under center (2005) Chad Ochocinco was merely an ordinary Johnson, Samkon Gado was altering the tilt of the fantasy sports world and Halle Berry was still deflecting the Noise\xe2\x80\x99s advancements. The mere presence of the 38-year-old passer spells doom for frustrated MoJo owners. The Chiefs have improved significantly in every aspect defensively, especially up front. On the season, they\xe2\x80\x99ve surrendered just 3.9 yards per carry to rushers. More impressively, no back has surpassed 75 rushing yards against them yet this season. In order to soften KC\xe2\x80\x99s secondary, MJD will be overworked early, but don\xe2\x80\x99t expect him to see much daylight. Overloaded boxes will undoubtedly keep him under wraps. Even when Garrard performed competently, the pint-sized rusher turned in several mediocre efforts. His current 3.9 ypc mark is the lowest of his career. Oompa Loompa doompadah dee, Jones-Drew is avoidable against KC.'

S'If there\xe2\x80\x99s one person PPR owners want in their fantasy foxhole each and every Sunday it\xe2\x80\x99s McCoy. Despite fighting through rib pain that could probably cripple even Chuck Norris, \xe2\x80\x9cShady\xe2\x80\x9d continues to function at a first-round level. On the season, he\xe2\x80\x99s racked 4.8 yards per carry, 111.3 total yards per game and five total touchdowns. But this week could be one of his few vanilla efforts. Despite its shortcomings in pass defense, Tennessee has plugged gaps effectively between the tackles, holding plowshares to just 3.8 yards per carry. Roster staples Rashard Mendenhall and Jones-Drew are two marquee rushers who notched lackluster performances against the Titans. Obviously, he can\xe2\x80\x99t be demoted in PPR formats. Because the Titans, who lead the NFL in sacks with 24, are a blitz-crazed bunch, McCoy will play a pivotal role as a check-down receiver. Four-to-six receptions are certainly in the cards. However, due to Tennessee\xe2\x80\x99s vertical insufficiencies, he could shoulder a lighter ground workload.'

S'Owners who believe Torain will again finish inside the position\xe2\x80\x99s top-10 are truly insane in the memb-rain. Yes, INSANE IN THE BRAIN! The Freight Train steamed his way to spectacular numbers Sunday night, plowing through and over the My Little Ponies. Though his 100-yard, two-TD effort was impressive, derailment is a strong possibility in the Windy City. Unlike Indy, the Bears have sealed off peripheral lanes with much success. Backs have averaged just shy of 4.0 yards per carry running left or right against them. More concerning, rushers have logged zero or negative yards on a carry 27.6 percent of the time versus Chicago, the highest mark in the league. Torain is a rising star who will should be a fairly consistent producer down the stretch, but on the road against the swarming Monsters of the Midway he warrants bench consideration. If he matches last week\xe2\x80\x99s output, we\xe2\x80\x99ll swim the Indianapolis canal in a sober state. Possible RB alternatives: Marshawn Lynch (vs. Ari), Peyton Hillis (at NO), Christopher Ivory (vs. Cle), Willis McGahee (vs. Buf)'

S'Defying his naysayers, the glass-half full receiver has turned back the clock, performing at a level reminiscent of 2006. Williams, not hotshot rookie Dez Bryant, has become Tony Romo\xe2\x80\x99s money man inside the red-zone. Currently the ninth-best wideout in the virtual game, he\xe2\x80\x99s hauled in five touchdown passes over the past three weeks, an amazing accomplishment when you consider Crisco naturally seeps from his pores. However, this is the week the scoring streak ends. The Giants secondary has clamped down on opponents yielding just four 70-yard wide receiver performances. Secondary options have also averaged a mere 36.2 yards against them. Complicating matters further, Dallas\xe2\x80\x99 inconsistencies in pass protection could create problems for Tony Romo. The G-Men, who\xe2\x80\x99ve notched 3.5 sacks per game, can really sniff out the quarterback. Though he\xe2\x80\x99s been one of fantasy\xe2\x80\x99s pleasant surprises, Williams will be spooned a strong dose of reality.'

S'Mariah is on fiyah. Under the direction of new offensive coordinator Mike Johnson, San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s famed diva has finally captured the spotlight. Over his past two contests, he\xe2\x80\x99s attracted 20 targets reeling in 13 passes for 162 yards and two touchdowns. However, this week expect him to drop off the charts. Panthers corner Chris Gamble is a very physical defender who will constantly jam and press Crabtree at the line, a style which has squelched several top receiving options. Ochocinco, Marques Colston and Johnny Knox all failed to reach the 40-yard mark against the former Buckeye. On the season, WR1s have averaged just 47.2 yards per game versus Carolina, the fourth-lowest tally in the league. Due to the Panthers\xe2\x80\x99 vulnerability up front, Frank Gore will be the point of emphasis, cutting into Crabtree\xe2\x80\x99s workload. Pan for fantasy gold elsewhere. Possible WR alternatives: Mike Wallace (at Mia), Robert Meachem (vs. Cle), Lance Moore (vs. Cle), Jason Avant (at Ten), Patrick Crayton (vs. NE), Mike Williams, Sea (vs. Ari), Derrick Mason (vs. Buf)'

S"The mutiny that's quietly brewed behind the scenes in Cincy has finally bubbled to the surface. Predictably, Terrell Owens erupted last week, venting his frustration with the Bengals' poor offensive execution and pitiful 2-10 record. Though he didn't throw Palmer under the bus, the deteriorating quarterback is at least partly responsible for the swoon in the Queen City. His shrinking YPA, questionable leadership and inadequte clock management skills have cost the team victories in close games. In reality, he's not a person to follow out of a foxhole. However, in fantasy, he could be an invaluable field general. Nicks and scrapes have left the Steelers vulnerable against the pass. Over the past five weeks, they've yielded an uncharacteristic 259.4 yards per game and seven touchdowns. Because of Pittsburgh's stoutness up front and susceptibility through the air, Palmer will be relied upon heavily, a situation he's excelled in previously. In his career versus Pittsburgh, the veteran passer has notched an 16:8 TD:INT split in 11 games. Toss in Owens\xe2\x80\x99 stark physical advantage over Bryant McFadden and Ike Taylor, and Palmer could finish with borderline top-10 numbers. Chase the cat."

S"Blount's alma mater, Oregon, is one win away from the National Championship. This week, the rookie rusher could bring his owners one step closer to their own trophy destiny. Similar in style and substance as Christian Okoye Tecmo Super Bowl '91, the bulldozing back totaled only the third 80-plus yard game against the Falcons this season, rushing for 103 yards on 20 carries. Despite the youngster's extraordinary peformance, Raheem Morris was displeased with Blount's execution in critical short-yardage situations. So upset was the head coach, he suggested Earnest Graham could overtake such duties. When he chooses to remove the clogs and focuses running full-steam downhill, Blount is almost impossible to stop. His combination of size and speed is devastating. Washington will soon know. Over the 'Skins' past eight games, they've conceded five 100-yard rushing games and nine TDs to RBs. Don't worry about Graham's possible expanded role. In a must-win game for Tampa, expect the rhino to spike the competition. "

S"Prior to last week\xe2\x80\x99s game against the Giants, Shanny jokingly threw down the gauntlet, hoping to push Torain. The back should feel so lucky. Remarks Lucifer recently made about incorrigible tub of butter Albert Haynesworth were rather harsh, yet well-deserved. Though James Davis and Keiland Williams will remain involved in the backfield rotation, it's clear, reading between the lines, Shanny wants Torain to be his primary ball carrier. Hamstrung for the past few weeks, the injury-plagued back was cleared by doctors to return to practice. If he doesn't suffer a setback, he should be reinserted as an RB2 in deeper leagues. The unfortunate loss of corner Aqib Talib is a crushing blow for a Tampa defense that has played well of late. Donovan McNabb should achieve ample success through the air which should open up sizable running lanes for the brawny rusher to plow through. The Bucs have struggled with gap execution allowing 4.8 yards per carry, 153.4 total yards per game and 11 touchdowns to RBs. Stay abreast of his situation, but with a strong week of practices, the Torain train should steam his way to solid numbers. Stoke the fire."

S'Beanie Wells\' lack of attention to detail has once again propelled the less talented Hightower into a featured role. Fumbles and poor blitz pick-up has "The Weenie" firmly planted in Ken Whisenhunt\'s doghouse. Last week, with an expanded workload, the former Richmond Spider carried the rock a season-high 15 times versus the Rams totaling 85 rushing yards. Against the AFC\'s softest run defense, a similar workload should be expected. More of sieve than WikiLeaks, the Broncos have surrendered 4.3 yards per carry, 164.4 total yards per game and 17 scores to RBs equal to the second-most fantasy points. How players will react post-McDaniels is hard to judge, but flimsy defenses normally aren\'t remedied immediately. Yes, rookie quarterback John Skelton, who will log his first NFL start, complicates Hightower\'s potential impact. Unless the green passer can keep the secondary honest, an extra defender will regularly creep into the box. Still, averaging 4.7 yards per carry on the season, Hightower is very capable of generating a handsome yield, especially if Denver\'s defensive leader, D.J. Williams, sits. '

S'Apparently, Roy lives in a delusional world where Abominable snowmen, talking reindeer and chastised elves who dream of cleaning bicuspids roam about the snow-covered landscape. On a local Dallas radio show, the overly confident receiver proclaimed, "I\'ve been the most consistent wide receiver that we have on our roster." Though the quote was laughable, Williams might actually live up to his remarks. Normally untrustworthy, he is a target worth gambling on with Dez Bryant sidelined. With ballhawk Asante Samuel, who will likely shadow Miles Austin, back in action, Williams could exploit his matchup against rotating pair Dimitri Patterson and Joselio Hanson. Over the past two weeks, the tandem has struggled mightily in pass coverage. More importantly, Bryant\'s absence means Williams could once again become a primary weapon inside the red-zone. Keep in mind, four of his five touchdowns scored this season have been on connections inside the 20. In a possible shootout, the self-anointed consistency king could pay a royal dividend. '

"The Professor" \xe2\x80\x93 he has ambitions of earning a Ph.D in the hopes of becoming a college lecturer after his career finishes \xe2\x80\x93 could teach the Patriots a hard lesson. Working as Jay Cutler\'s primary greaseman, the slot receiver has become an indispensable part of the Bears\' passing attack. Exploiting soft spots in zone coverage, he has amassed 11 receptions for 160 yards and two scores over the past two weeks. Cutler, who was a teammate of Bennett\'s while at Vanderbilt, has a strong rapport with his WR3. This week, the pair\'s bond won\'t be threatened. New England has failed miserably defending the slot. Jordan Shipley, Roscoe Parrish, Davone Bess, Percy Harvin and Blair White all notched at least eight fantasy points in clashes with the Pats. Based on the loose coverage the competition has played, Bennett has favorable odds of finishing well inside the WR top-30 this week. He\'s quickly becoming this year\'s version of Devin Aromashodu.

S'The phenomenally skilled rookie from Oregon could become an overnight sensation. Todd Heap, who pulled up lame on the very first play against Pittsburgh Sunday night, has already been declared "out" this week. Filling in for the injured star, Dickson performed admirably catching three passes for 21 yards. Garnering a healthy seven targets, he certainly has the confidence of Joe Flacco. Tabbed as one of the best pass-catching tight ends in this year\'s draft class, he possesses terrific size (6-foot-5, 243-pounds) and elite athleticism, traits comparable to Jermichael Finley. Expect him to be a matchup nightmare for the Texans. No defense has been more generous to tight ends than Houston. On the season, enlarged targets have scored seven touchdowns and tallied 6.2 receptions and 72.2 yards per game against them. Dickson told the Baltimore Sun he wants to "Do his job and not miss a beat." Considering the ultra-useful matchup, he will surely play an integral role in the Ravens\' vertical game-plan. Owners plagued by inconsistency at TE should give the rookie a shot.  '

S'Once the most feared quarterback in physical and pixilated form \xe2\x80\x93 it was unfair to play with the Falcons in Madden 7 \xe2\x80\x93 many wonder how Vick will perform as a starter roughly two years removed from juking prison \xe2\x80\x9cBubbas.\xe2\x80\x9d Fanatics needn\xe2\x80\x99t be worried. After Kevin Kolb was sent to the sidelines dazed and confused last week against Green Bay, the former Pro Bowler turned back the clock passing for 175 yards and a touchdown while rushing for a ridiculous 103 yards on 11 carries. Against another NFC North foe, expect the numbers to be even better. Due to Vick\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness rolling off play-action, the Lions will likely slide coverage in an attempt to contain the fleet-footed QB. Unfortunately, they will fail epically. Last week, Jay Cutler carved up Detroit for 372 yards and two scores, chipping in an additional 22 rushing yards on the ground. No spy, not even James Bond, will be able to handcuff Vick. Andy Reid is stubbornly committed to Kolb, but after what will surely be a banner week for the backup, impatient Philly fans will want to hurl the incumbent into the Delaware. If you cashed in on Vick via free agency, activate him immediately.'

S'Ryan Grant\xe2\x80\x99s season-ending ankle injury thrust Jackson into the catbird seat at running back, and emptied the FAAB wallets of fantasy players. Rumors are starting to surface the Packers could inquire about the price tag for Marshawn Lynch. However, a deal doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear imminent. Jackson, a former second-round pick in 2007, will be given every opportunity to place a stranglehold on the starting job against Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s club. In terms of overall skills, the 24-year-old isn\xe2\x80\x99t exciting. But a runner doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to showcase flashy talents in a one-cut-and-go scheme. Just look at what Arian Foster has already accomplished in a similar system. Equipped with solid break-tackle ability and plus-versatility, Jackson should be effective in spurts, especially this week. Last week he totaled 75 yards on 20 touches against a stingy Eagles defense. The Bills\xe2\x80\x99 newly installed 3-4 defense performed well against Miami in Week 1, but were still pounded on the ground for 147 total yards and a touchdown by Ricky Williams and Ronnie Brown. Because of the Packers\xe2\x80\x99 unstoppable passing game, the fourth-year rusher should see sizable holes to scoot through. Mike McCarthy expressed supreme confidence in Jackson as \xe2\x80\x9can every-down back\xe2\x80\x9d four weeks ago. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s his time to prove it. For the now penniless owners who won his services, plug him in as an RB2.'

S'Hidden behind Brandon Jacobs over the past couple seasons, the Bride of Frankenstein has finally pulled back the veil to reveal his true fantasy beauty. Wearing the pants in the Giants\xe2\x80\x99 backfield, Bradshaw totaled a rousing 93 yards and a touchdown opening week versus Carolina. Expected to maintain a 60-percent workload, his encore performance will be significantly more monstrous. The Colts were embarrassed by Foster last week, conceding 231 yards and three touchdowns, the second-best Week 1 rushing performance in NFL history. The absence of defensive cog Bob Sanders cripples an already undersized, vulnerable unit. Healthy and revitalized, the Giants\xe2\x80\x99 offensive line should easily win the war in the trenches. Tom Coughlin, similar to what Gary Kubiak did a week ago, will follow a conservative approach early in an attempt to control the clock and Peyton Manning. In the battle of the Mannings, Bradshaw will steal the show. Trust him as an RB2 in 10-team and deeper leagues.'

S'\xe2\x80\xa8In terms of fantasy contributions, most would characterize the \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d Moss as generally worthless. Based on his rather bland impact (70-902-3) despite a hefty workload (120 targets) a season ago, his haters have good reason to spew vitriol. However, with Donovan McNabb now manning the controls, Moss should be routinely useful this year, this week in particular. Kareem Jackson and Glover Quin are physical corners who will try to disrupt Moss by jamming him at the line. However, the veteran wideout still possesses enough speed to burn either defender deep. The pair was manhandled by Indy pass catchers a week ago surrendering four 20-plus yard connections and 317 receiving yards. Anticipate the M&M combination to wreak havoc downfield. Coming off a serviceable six-catch, 77-yard effort against the \xe2\x80\x98Boys (10 targets), Moss deserves a WR2 designation in 10-team and deeper leagues this week.'

With Jason Campbell behind center, the Crypt Keeper (Al Davis) has stressed his desire to take shots downfield. To prevent beheading, look for Tom Cable to follow orders this week. The Rams could enter Week 2 very thin at cornerback with Justin King and Kevin Dockery hamstrung. Even when the not-so-golden secondary was at 100-percent a week ago, it allowed 204 yards and a touchdown to Arizona receivers. Count on Murphy as an upside WR3 option in 12-team and deeper leagues.'

Though the sure-handed rusher uncharacteristically lost a fumble in the loss, he finished the afternoon with a functional 65 total yards and a touchdown on 14 touches. A repeat performance is likely against KC. Late last year, Jerome Harrison demoralized the Chiefs for a franchise record 298 total yards and three touchdowns. Despite the unforgettable effort, it appears the coaching staff will continue to employ a near 50/50 timeshare. Glenn Dorsey and company, aided by Mother Nature, played brilliantly Monday night against the Chargers, limiting electric rookie Ryan Mathews to just 3.9 yards per carry. However, their exceptional play may be a mirage. Keep in mind, the Chiefs finished 31st against the run last year. Typically, a major tide shift in defensive identity doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen overnight. Battling the Browns\xe2\x80\x99 quality offensive line is a far more daunting task. Whether Jake Delhomme or Seneca Wallace is at the helm, Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s pesky nuisance should ram his way to handsome flex totals. There\xe2\x80\x99s fantasy gold in \xe2\x80\x98dem \xe2\x80\x98der Hillis!!!'

S'Cutler routinely slugs back cans of Smug Light, but this week in Dallas, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be served a large glass of humble. Underneath his stupendous fantasy line from a week ago (372-2-1, 22 rushing yards) the turnover magnet couldn\xe2\x80\x99t avoid his usual missteps, gifting the Lions the football twice. Though he was able to overcome his mistakes with relative ease agasint Detroit, the same won\xe2\x80\x99t be true against a more formidable Cowboys secondary. Including last week\xe2\x80\x99s donut from Donovan McNabb, Mike Jenkins and company have allowed just one multi-TD passer since Week 8 of last year. Earlier this week Cutler credited the Dallas defense for being \xe2\x80\x9cphysical, fast\xe2\x80\x9d and, most insightfully, moving around to \xe2\x80\x9cdo some stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d As Bears fans witnessed all too often a year ago, the prized quarterback is poised for an ego-deflating meltdown.'

S'Dysfunctional is a description which normally typifies the other Bay Area team, not the Niners. However, Gore and company currently have more problems than Kate Gosselin does kids. As Y! colleague Jason Cole reported earlier this week, communication breakdowns between Alex Smith and offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye have been commonplace. Unfairly, the quarterback, not the man calling the plays, received the brunt of the blame for San Fran\xe2\x80\x99s laughable effort last week in Seattle. Gore has demanded more touches this week against the defending world champs and likely will be featured early, but don\xe2\x80\x99t expect headline numbers when the dust settles. The Niners offense is simply too disoriented right now. Throw in San Fran\xe2\x80\x99s inability to contain Drew Brees, and Gore could be the second-straight consensus top-five pick to notch lackluster numbers against New Orleans. Darren McFadden (vs. StL), Brandon Jackson (vs. Buf) and Ahmad Bradshaw (at Ind) are stronger plays.'

S'Our adoration for Best is well-known. Recall, we anointed him the Ray Rice of 2010 back in August. However, even the Baltimore back had a couple gut-punching efforts a season ago. This will be the Cal product\xe2\x80\x99s first. Overshadowed by his two touchdowns, the rookie averaged a paltry 1.4 yards per carry against the Bears in Week 1. The stingy Eagles will likely limit the rusher to another flavorless per clip average this week. With Shaun Hill at the helm, Best will be tested. Can he handle the expanded workload and added pressure in the face of an unflinching opponent? Probably not. Due to his versatility and explosiveness in the open field, he will surely be the focal point of Sean McDermott\xe2\x80\x99s defensive game plan. Unless Hill can keep the defense honest early by stretching the field with Calvin Johnson, overstacked boxes will be prevalent. Keep in mind Philly has surrendered only one 100-yard rusher in their past 24 games. Make that 25. Only deep PPR players should roll the dice.'

S'Against the Purple People Eaters, Brown will be a fantasy clown. As experienced owners know, the Williams Wall is practically immovable. Only two rushers, Matt Forte (2008) and Cedric Benson (2009), have surpassed 80 rushing yards in a game against the Vikes in their past 24 contests at home. Because of Chad Henne\xe2\x80\x99s struggles in Buffalo (21-34, 182 yards, 0 TDs), stopping the run will be task No. 1 for defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier. Though Brown feels revitalized, he\xe2\x80\x99s still in a strict platoon with Ricky Williams. Given the split in carries and unfavorable matchup he needs to be benched in all but the deepest of leagues. Peyton Hillis (vs. KC), LaDainian Tomlinson (vs. NE) and Beanie Wells (at Atl) posses more upside in Week 2.'

S"On the road against an underappreciated Browns secondary, Matt Cassel\xe2\x80\x99s top vertical weapon will be more Rain-Bowe Brite than Ram-Bowe. Slippery conditions obviously played a major factor in the wideout\xe2\x80\x99s invisible performance Monday night against the Chargers. Targeted the same number of times as Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Anthony Armstrong, he hauled in just one catch for 13 yards. The only direction for Bowe is up, but don\xe2\x80\x99t expect spectacular totals in Cleveland. The Chihuahuas held the top target in check last season at Arrowhead, limiting him to four catches for 56 yards. Due to Cleveland's shortcomings on run defense, thunder and lightning combination Thomas Jones and Jamaal Charles will be the point of offensive emphasis. Keep in mind only two wideouts eclipsed 80 yards against the Browns at home last year. Mohamed Massaquoi (vs. KC), Steve Breaston (at Atl), Legedu Naanee (vs. Jac) and Austin Collie (vs. NYG) are sounder options."

S'Maybe if Moss hires a voluptuous model to dress provocatively and \xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d from the Jets sideline, he could create a big enough distraction to escape from Revis Island. Then again, maybe not. The blanketing corner has absolutely owned the multi-time Pro Bowler in recent meetings. Last year, the \xe2\x80\x9ccountry strong\xe2\x80\x9d receiver posted wimpy numbers against him, catching just nine passes for 58 yards and a touchdown in two games. Revis moved around versus the Ravens but is expected to be fixed on Moss. With that in mind, Wes Welker, Kevin Faulk and dark-horse Brandon Tate should be Tom Brady\xe2\x80\x99s primary targets. In this case, the \xe2\x80\x9cslouch\xe2\x80\x9d description definitely applies. Louis Murphy (vs. StL), Greg Camarillo (vs. Mia) and T.J. Houshmandzadeh (at Cin) are better gambles. Trust Moss against Revis and you have less common sense than Clinton Portis.'

S"Kitna\xe2\x80\x99s appearance may be more reminiscent of a strip club bouncer than a trusty NFL quarterback, but, this week, the journeyman passer will smell like fruit-filled rainbows. After he led a sickly offense to a shocking upset win last week in New York, overnight the Cowboys were rehabilitated. Rediscovering Miles Austin and Felix Jones in the passing game, Kitna threw for 327 yards and three touchdowns, the finest single game performance by a signal caller against the NFC East pacesetter this year. More importantly, he continued to forge an unbreakable bond with student Dez Bryant, a relationship the veteran recently compared to sustaining matrimonial bliss. Instead of foot massages and roses, targets have pleased the rookie. Since Kitna took over first-team snaps for Tony Romo in Week 8, the pair have connected for 19 receptions, 274 yards (91.3/game) and two touchdowns. Jim Schwartz\xe2\x80\x99s defense, particularly the secondary, has shown steady improvement. Last week in Buffalo, corners Chris Houston and Alphonso Smith limited waiver sensation Ryan Fitzpatrick to his lowest single game output this year (11.4 fpts). Still, as Mark Sanchez proved in Week 9 (323-1-1), this is an undersized secondary which is at a noticeable disadvantage size-wise against Dallas' receiving trees. Cowboy up."

S'Is your season hanging in the balance? Are you the victim of running back inconsistency? Is your soon-to-be ex-wife trying to steal the shirt of your back? For assistance with these problems and any other legal needs, call the law offices of BenJarvus Green-Ellis. Breaking away from New England\xe2\x80\x99s two-man committee last week, the third-year back accomplished a feat no rusher had previously this season \xe2\x80\x93 he broke the 60-yard mark on the ground against the vaunted Steelers defense. He also chipped in 36 receiving yards. This week against an undersized, outmatched Colts defensive front similar numbers could be achieved. Indianapolis has surrendered 4.9 yards per carry, 147.9 total yards per game and nine touchdowns to RBs this season equal to the 10th-most fantasy points. Only Cedric Benson in Week 10 failed to eclipse the 80-yard mark against them. Whether Fred Taylor suits up or not is irrelevant, BJE is clearly the Patriots\xe2\x80\x99 best ground option. Due to the suffocating nature of the Cover 2, Bill Belichick will likely install a conservative game-plan in order to attack Indy\xe2\x80\x99s greatest weakness, defending the edge. On runs off-tackle, the Colts have given up a ridiculous 5.8 yards per carry. Fire the musket.'

S'Incognito over the past two weeks, Jones has finally taken a backseat to the younger, more explosive Jamaal Charles. At least, temporarily. A victim of a first-quarter drubbing by Denver and a dramatically improved Oakland rush D, he\xe2\x80\x99s totaled just 54 yards during that stretch. Don\xe2\x80\x99t expect the funk to prolong. Arizona is abhorrent defensively, particularly in gap execution. Whale-wide holes have become commonplace. On the season, the Cardinals have yielded 4.6 yards per carry, 168.3 total yards per game and 12 touchdowns to rushers equal to the most fantasy points. Suffice it to say, they won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to contain a run-first offense. The Noise has better odds of out-sprinting the JC of KC in the 100-meter dash. In what could become a lopsided affair, Jones will be worked tirelessly. His third 100-yard performance of the season is definitely attainable, especially if the Cards are again minus defensive catalyst Darnell Dockett. Bang the tribal drum.'

However, Reggie is the resilient type capable of shrugging off the harshest adversity. This week, against a hapless Seattle defense, he\xe2\x80\x99ll prove his adaptability. In a local radio interview this week, Drew Brees has sounded like a child who recently rediscovered a lost toy. The quarterback is anxious to get Bush back on the field, and in space. Ladell Betts, Christopher Ivory and Julius Jones will still be involved in the backfield rotation, but the shifty rusher will unquestionably carve out a large role in the passing game. The \xe2\x80\x98Hawks have yielded an NFL-worst 12.4 yards per catch to RBs this season. Screens and dump-offs to Bush could turn into long gains. The versatile rusher, who feels \xe2\x80\x9cmore than 100-percent,\xe2\x80\x9d won\xe2\x80\x99t be eased back. Trust the skill set. Trust the matchup.'

Pleased with the coaching staff\xe2\x80\x99s communicative philosophy, the fleet-footed receiver will likely call his own number several times this week.

Holmes\xe2\x80\x99 terrific route-running, elite speed and elusiveness poses a significant problem.

Expect Washington to also bark loudly. As anticipated, the Randy Moss Effect immediately aided the WR2. Though Kerry Collins and Vince Young failed to deliver passes crisply to the wideout, he was targeted a season-high nine times, hauling in three passes for 26 yards and a touchdown. As Michael Vick exposed in an historic performance Monday, the \xe2\x80\x98Skins are one step below atrocious in pass defense. Constantly outmaneuvered and outsmarted, DeAngelo Hall and cohorts have conceded 32 pass plays of 20-plus yards, the seventh-most in the league. To take advantage of Washington\xe2\x80\x99s defensive inadequacies, look for The Dinger to draw up several explosive pass plays to loosen up back end coverage. Due to the attention Moss will draw, Washington should again reap plenty of statistical riches. Do you think the outspoken receiver will soon retract his brainy \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think we need him (Moss)\xe2\x80\x9d statement?"

S'Owners looking for a one-way ticket to \xe2\x80\x9cLucky Town\xe2\x80\x9d should cue up the Boss and press play. Minus Steve Smith for the next several weeks, the ogre from Oregon will undertake a substantial role in the passing game, functioning as Eli Manning\xe2\x80\x99s primary greaseman. Last week\xe2\x80\x99s, five-catch, 85-yard, 1-TD performance against the Cowboys was only a preview. The Eagles\xe2\x80\x99 generosity toward tight ends is well-documented. Not since 2007 have they ranked outside the top 10 in points allowed to the position. Currently they check in at No. 5, yielding five receptions and 61.3 receptions per game. Monolithic targets have also splashed six against them five times since Week 4. Given the G-man\xe2\x80\x99s enormous 6-foot-6 frame he is a matchup concern for Stewart Bradley and company. Owners frustrated with inconsistency at tight end should consult the Boss. Assuming his bruised tailbone isn\xe2\x80\x99t inhibitive, a top-10 effort in Week 11 appears very likely.'

S'We\xe2\x80\x99re in utter shock Ryan Reynolds and not the world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest neckbeard fashioner was named People\xe2\x80\x99s Sexiest Man Alive. With a per week average second only to Philip Rivers, spurred by five multi-TD and 300-yard games, he\xe2\x80\x99s one delicious piece of fantasy man-candy (Mandy perhaps?). Despite our infatuation with the former Chicago party boy, he is untrustworthy this week against an underappreciated San Diego defense. On the season, the Bolts have electrocuted QBs, conceding just 6.5 yards per attempt, 203.1 yards per game and eight touchdowns equal to second-fewest fantasy points. Vince Young is the only signal caller to throw for multiple scores against them. Orton has benefited from terrific frontline protection, but against a recharged D fresh off the bye, he could get badgered often in the pocket. Shaun Phillips and friends have tallied 27 sacks this season, the second-most in the league. Also, the Chargers have given up few explosive pass plays ranking second in fewest 40-yard pass plays allowed. Handcuffing Brandon Lloyd won\xe2\x80\x99t be that tall of a task. Except for those in deeper formats, saddle someone else. Possible QB Alternatives: Mark Sanchez (vs. Hou), Jon Kitna (vs. Det), Shaun Hill (at Dal), Carson Palmer (vs. Buf), Matt Cassel (vs. Ari)'

S'Goodness, gracious, owners who start The Burner this week better have \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Balls of Fire.\xe2\x80\x9d The Rams, once a laughable run defense, have improved by leaps and bounds this season. Excelling in gap responsibility and control, they\xe2\x80\x99ve surrendered a lowly 117.8 total yards per game and four scores to backs equal to the ninth-fewest fantasy points. Most impressively, 38.4-percent of RB runs against them have resulted in zero or negative yards, the third-best mark in the league. At home, St. Louis is very unwelcoming. No rusher has exited the Edward Jones Dome with 70 or more rushing yards this year. The Falcons are a very balanced offense known for keeping defenses off-kilter. But, as seen versus Baltimore in Week 10, they will abandon the run if necessary. Considering the Rams\xe2\x80\x99 success against North-South runners, Turner\xe2\x80\x99s style doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match up favorably. Containing Jason Snelling\xe2\x80\x99s multiplicities will be a more difficult assignment. Spags\xe2\x80\x99 bunch has yielded 5.8 receptions per game to RBs, the seventh-most in the league. Extinguish The Burner in shallow formats.'

S'If there was ever a week Run DMC were to trip over his phat Adidas laces, this is it. The former first-rounder\xe2\x80\x99s transformation this season has been nothing short of remarkable. No longer apprehensive tap-dancing behind the line, McFadden is attacking opponents more vigorously and, as he noted, has become more elusive on the second level. His increased aggressiveness has led to extraordinary results. With seven straight 100-plus total yard performances, he\xe2\x80\x99s second only to demigod Arian Foster in points per game among RBs. Pittsburgh is a bruised defense. Troy Polamalu and cohorts are battling various physical ailments. But this still one of the league\xe2\x80\x99s most suffocating units, particularly against the run. The Steelers have surrendered just 2.9 yards per carry, 95.4 total yards per game and three TDs to RBs this year. BenJarvus Green-Ellis \xe2\x80\x9cgashed\xe2\x80\x9d them for a season-high 89 yards last week. It won\xe2\x80\x99t happen two weeks in a row, especially at home. Keep McFadden active in PPR formats, but owners in standard leagues with a suitable crutch should strongly consider the alternative.'

S'Even with an enticing matchup, Benson\xe2\x80\x99s odds of exceeding the century mark are equal to Chad Ochocinco\xe2\x80\x99s engagement surviving the season. The Bengals\xe2\x80\x99 offensive line, now minus Andre Smith, has struggled mightily creating running lanes for the plodding rusher. Fantasy\xe2\x80\x99s 22nd-best RB has averaged a pedestrian 3.6 yards per carry and 80.8 total yards per game. Increased reliance on Terrell Owens, Ochowhino and Jermaine Gresham, especially inside the red zone, has drowned Benson\xe2\x80\x99s overall value. He\xe2\x80\x99s truly become the Matt Forte of the AFC, sans the receptions. His horrific 51 total yards last week against one of the league\xe2\x80\x99s softest defensive fronts, Indianapolis, is a prime example of his futility. Don\xe2\x80\x99t expect a miraculous turnaround. Yes, the Bills are exploitable in the trenches. They\xe2\x80\x99ve surrendered 4.6 yards per carry, 178 total yards per game and eight scores to RBs this season. But Cincy\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on the pass and continued run-blocking issues suggest another letdown is in store for Benson. An undisclosed foot injury, which cost him practice time Wednesday, only increases the likelihood. Ced\xe2\x80\x99s dead, baby. Ced\xe2\x80\x99s dead. Possible RB Alternatives: BenJarvus Green-Ellis (vs. Ind), Felix Jones (vs. Det), Mike Tolbert (vs. Den), Reggie Bush (vs. Sea), Thomas Jones (vs. Ari)'

S'In almost all phases of the game, Carolina would get owned by most UFL teams. It truly is a franchise in complete disarray. However, similar to last year, the club\xe2\x80\x99s lone silver lining remains its secondary. Only one receiver, Mario Manningham back in Week 1, has reached 80-yards against Chris Gamble and company this year. They\xe2\x80\x99ve also conceded just seven touchdowns to wideouts and an outstanding 6.4 yards per pass attempt. Boldin likely won\xe2\x80\x99t be the second. This game screams early blowout. With third-stringer Tony Pike behind center for the Panthers, the Ravens defense could feast. Unless Carolina, miraculously, is competitive, Ray Rice and Willis McGahee will likely shoulder the offensive workload. When passing opportunities inside the red zone are presented, resurgent tight end Todd Heap, not Boldin, may become Joe Flacco\xe2\x80\x99s weapon of choice. The Panthers have allowed the third-most fantasy points to TEs this year. A disappearing act similar to Week 9 (2-28-0 vs Mia) could be forthcoming for the WR1.'

S'The Bengals\xe2\x80\x99 bracket scheme will be Kryptonite to Captain Consistent. Not even the power of the mohawk will be able to stop it. Johnson has been a revelation in his third season. Chan Gailey\xe2\x80\x99s yards-consuming spread offense and Ryan Fitzpatrick\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in him are the primary reasons for his ascension. Averaging a stout 10.6 fantasy points per week in standard formats, he ranks alongside Boldin and ahead of notable names Reggie Wayne, Greg Jennings and Miles Austin in overall value. Most would predict Johnson, coming off a disappointing three receptions for 37 yards against Detroit, won\xe2\x80\x99t post consecutive duds. However, Jonathan Joseph and Leon Hall have defended the intermediate field, an area where the receiver typically operates, extremely well. Only three wideouts have tallied 70-yards or more against the Bengals this season. Because of the Buffalo\xe2\x80\x99s defensive inefficiencies, racking points in garbage time is always a possibility, but, on paper, starting Johnson this week is a risky proposition. Possible WR Alternatives: Nate Washington (vs. Was), Danny Woodhead (vs. Ind), Mohamed Massaquoi (at Jac), Mike Thomas (vs. Cle), Danny Amendola (vs. Atl), Santonio Holmes (vs. Hou)'

Charitable best describes Houston\xe2\x80\x99s secondary. Through three games it has surrendered an insane 381 passing yards per game and six aerial touchdowns. Obviously, the undrafted Toledo product isn\xe2\x80\x99t remotely close to the talent class of Peyton Manning, Donovan McNabb and Tony Romo, but he\xe2\x80\x99s no Purple Drank either. Though he completed only 50 percent of his attempts last week in the desert he sill finished with a notable 255 passing yards and a touchdown. His sidearm habits and chucked ducks continue to infuriate local writers, but the Texans can disguise any mechanical flaw. Considering his budding chemistry with Louis Murphy and Zach Miller and scrambling ability when pressured, he could easily puncture the QB top 10. All \xe2\x80\x98Ski, \xe2\x80\x98Ski got dam!'

S'Preseason, most, including yours truly, would\xe2\x80\x99ve taken out a second mortgage betting on LT adding 2010 to his Jets tattoombstone. However, with every sizable gain, the thirty-something rusher has slapped his critics in the face. Watching the old Vizio Sunday night, the future Hall of Famer exhibited the vision, burst, versatility and cutback skills of yesteryear. In his first start this year, the former Charger ripped off 88 total yards and a touchdown against a solid Dolphins defense. Shonn Greene will continue to steal roughly 10-12 carries per game, but it\xe2\x80\x99s clear LT will remain atop the depth chart for the foreseeable future. Although Mark Sanchez has blossomed, Rex Ryan will undoubtedly employ a conservative approach this week against a Bills defense which has yielded 4.4 yards per carry, 146 total yards per game and four scores to rushers. Due to his growing role and revitalized talents it\xe2\x80\x99s time, as Torsha Tomlinson told the Daily News Monday, to jump back on the bandwagon. The scariest RB of the past decade has regained his fearsome appearance.'

But after Forsett tallied 20 touches last week versus San Diego it\xe2\x80\x99s clear Pete Carroll has finally realized Julius Jones can\xe2\x80\x99t outrun a giant Galapagos tortoise. The last time the diminutive back visited the Gateway City he posted heavenly numbers (22-130-2). The encore could be almost as good. St. Louis has continued to struggle stopping the run, giving up 5.1 yards per carry and 157 total yards per game to rushers. Injuries and a lack of chemistry up front have handicapped the \xe2\x80\x98Hawks\xe2\x80\x99 running game. This week it should finally get on track. Even with Clifton Ryan expected to return for the Rams, Forsett should accumulate noteworthy numbers in his first standout performance of the year. Start him with supreme confidence.'

S'Mariah, Aretha and a whole lot of Whitney rolled into one, the San Francisco diva may finally belt out a chart-topping tune. Jimmy Raye\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal should remove the padlock from the Niners playbook. Alex Smith, who historically has operated more effectively out of the gun, will likely get an opportunity to play his style of game. Despite ongoing communication problems between Smith and Crabtree the pair should be able to reconnect the severed line. Similar to last season, the Falcons have struggled in pass coverage. At least one receiver has surpassed 80 receiving yards against them in each of their first three games. No. 1 targets have also performed 14.6 percent above the league average versus Dunta Robinson. The second-year wideout has averaged an appalling two receptions and 27 yards per game thus far. However, with the Niners already in desperation mode and Josh Morgan ailing, he will be more than just a cameo in Week 4. Plant the Crabtree in your starting lineup.'

S'Anthony Hargrove\xe2\x80\x99s motivational \xe2\x80\x9cdance\xe2\x80\x9d last week versus Atlanta must have lit a fire under Moore. Sir Lance-a-lot, a key waiver wire acquisition two years ago, hauled in a massive payload, catching six passes for a career-best 149 yards and two touchdowns. Amazingly, the single-game total surpassed what he accomplished in seven contests a year ago. With Reggie Bush sidelined, Moore has once again become an integral piece to New Orleans\xe2\x80\x99 offensive puzzle. Against a flimsy Carolina D, another potent dose of targets should be expected. The Panthers have allowed the 10th-most 20-yard pass plays this season. Considering Marques Colston will draw Chris Gamble and friends in coverage, Moore will thrive in several one-on-one situations. It\xe2\x80\x99s rare New Orleans wide receivers post consecutive stellar weeks. After all, with the Hugo Chavez of quarterbacks, Drew Brees, running the offense, socialism is the Saints\xe2\x80\x99 passing philosophy. But Brees has had considerable success recently against the Panthers, which bodes well for Moore. Last year, he burned them for 330 yards and a score. Coming off a disappointing loss to Atlanta, the Saints march all over Carolina.'

S'Though Rob Gronkowski is cemented as the Pats\xe2\x80\x99 primary goal-line tight end, Hernandez has developed into quite the efficient force between the 20s. On just 15 targets, he\xe2\x80\x99s amassed 13 receptions for 211 yards, the fourth-highest output at the position. Due to his plus size (6-foot-2, 245-pounds), athleticism and sharp route-running skills, the rookie poses a matchup problem for a Dolphins defense which has fared poorly in containing tight ends. So far this season, monoliths have performed 49.8 percent above the league average against them. Dustin Keller and Visanthe Shiancoe each achieved marked success in their matchups with the \xe2\x80\x98Fins. Look for Tom Brady to line Hernandez up in the crosshairs often, making the former Gator\xe2\x80\x99s return to Florida memorable. For Jason Witten, Kellen Winslow and Shiancoe owners in shallow leagues, the still widely available Patriot is your bye week remedy.'

S'The Marshawn Lynch to Green Bay rumors may be increasing in intensity, but for one week only, the Packers\xe2\x80\x99 rushing attack will perform a step above marginal. Because Brandon Jackson couldn\xe2\x80\x99t power through a wall of thinly sliced Swiss, Kuhn, a converted fullback, could see an uptick in carries in an attempt to jumpstart the ground game. Last week in Chicago, Kuhn totaled 51 yards on just eight touches. Ndamukong Suh was supposed to rectify the Hello Kitties\xe2\x80\x99 loathsome run defense, but it\xe2\x80\x99s still clearly in rebuilding mode. The bloodied unit has allowed a ridiculous 5.2 yards per carry, 208.3 total yards per game and seven touchdowns to rushers in three games. Since Aaron Rodgers, who averaged 353 yards per game in two contests against the NFC North doormat last year, will be able to operate uninhibitedly, the poor man\xe2\x80\x99s Peyton Hillis could be thrust into several goal-line opportunities. The Packers have to establish the run at some point. This week is their best opportunity to see what the Kuhn Dog is capable of. Label him an upside flex option in deeper leagues.'

S"The City of Brotherly Love may temporarily embrace McNabb, but eventually a hail of Duracells will come raining down on the former Eagle. Turning up the heat is Sean McDermott\xe2\x80\x99s M.O. on defense. The aggressive unit ranks second in the NFL with 12 sacks. Typically, McNabb is dangerous when pressured. His ability to seek out targets accurately while on the run has been one of his calling cards. However, the Eagles are very familiar with his tendencies. And their secondary is no slouch. So far this season, green-clad defenders have limited passers to just 209.3 yards per game and forced five interceptions. The Chunky Soup maestro completed a mere 59.4 percent of his attempts a week ago against hapless St. Louis. He\xe2\x80\x99s also yet to tally a multi-TD performance. Another painfully mediocre effort appears imminent. Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99re bending the rules of our own little game, but with many owners suffering from the bye week blues \xe2\x80\x93 or lifeless performances provided by mummified Brett Favre \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99re confident McNabb\xe2\x80\x99s start percentage will rise at or close to qualifying level come kickoff. Unfortunately, for those needing a one-week boost, Asante Samuel and Ellis Hobbs will ruin McNabb's homecoming. Possible Week 4 QB alternatives: Bruce Gradkowski (vs. Hou), Chad Henne (vs. NE), Sam Bradford (vs. Sea), Alex Smith (at Atl), Matt Hasselbeck (at StL)"

S"In the Battle for Buckeye State supremacy, Benson will accidentally leave the nutcracker in the kitchen drawer. Concerns over the veteran\xe2\x80\x99s sore knee has pushed Marvin Lewis to install a loose committee with Benson and Bernard Scott. The Bengals head coach believes his workhorse won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to remain whole at his current 347 carries pace. Bears fans aren't sure he can again eclipse 250. This week against the Chihuahuas, Benson could cede roughly 7-10 touches to the more explosive backup. Compared to a year ago, Cleveland has greatly improved against the run. No longer allergic to tackling, the Browns have successfully executed gap assignments. Against the likes of Ray Rice, Thomas Jones and Jamaal Charles, they\xe2\x80\x99ve allowed just 3.9 yards per carry and zero touchdowns. With frustration over Cincy\xe2\x80\x99s stagnant offense \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding,\xe2\x80\x9d another uneventful week should be expected. Feel free to dial 1-800-HELP-FTC for further \xe2\x80\x9cfantasy\xe2\x80\x9d assistance related to Bengals players."

S'Americans worried about illegal immigration should encourage the government to hire the Steel Curtain to protect the nation\xe2\x80\x99s borders. No person, not even Chris Johnson, can penetrate it. Pittsburgh has limited rushers to a lowly 81.3 total yards per game and 2.6 yards per carry. Though Rice compiled 155 total yards per game in two contests against the AFC North nemesis a season ago, he simply can\xe2\x80\x99t be trusted in the rematch. Despite missing practice time with a bruised knee, the youngster is expected to suit up, at least according to Willis McGahee. Whether Rice plays or not, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite possible McGahee will be leaned on more heavily than usual. Because of his presumed physical limitations and unfavorable matchup, the Long Gain Rice should be avoided. Unless you\xe2\x80\x99re in a deep PPR league, employ a fallback option.'

Currently ranked No. 12 among RBs in points per game, the Bride of Frankenstein has delivered monstrous numbers, totaling 100 yards per contest with two touchdowns. Expect him to fall well short of his seasonal average this week. The Bears are a voracious run defense. Julius Peppers and company have yet to allow a back to surpass 40 yards in a game. Yes, Chicago hasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly faced a murderers row of rushers outside Jahvid Best, but this is still a talented defense playing with supreme confidence. The Giants offensive line, no longer the defender-displacing force it was just two seasons ago, will be manhandled. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a masochist, start him. However, if you're a realist, find a replacement. Possible Week 4 RB alternatives: Peyton Hillis (vs. Cin), LaDainian Tomlinson/Shonn Greene (at Buf), Justin Forsett (at StL), John Kuhn (vs. Det)"

S'Compared to last season, Megatron has transformed not into a Porsche or 10-ton tank, but an El Camino on blocks. On the young season, he\xe2\x80\x99s averaged just 4.7 receptions and 50.3 yards per game with one score, sadly equivalent to Roscoe Parrish\xe2\x80\x99s fantasy production. As the Free Press detailed earlier this week, several reasons for Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing start are to blame \xe2\x80\x93 Nate Burleson\xe2\x80\x99s absence, scattered distribution of targets, increased attention from defenses, etc. As the gifted wideout has seen all year, Green Bay will almost certainly rotate an extra safety over the top to contain him. In the past, the Packers employed a similar strategy, netting fruitless results for Johnson. Last season in his lone matchup against the divisional foe, he hauled in just two catches for 10 yards. Another listless performance is likely. Keep in mind, Charles Woodson and friends have held No. 1 targets to just 23.0 yards per game this season, the second-lowest mark in the league.'

S"Speaking as a disgruntled owner pressed into starting David Garrard in a 20-team league (we lost Matthew Stafford Week 1), the Jaguars are an offensive abomination. Miscues, misreads and misfires have become commonplace. Save for racking quality numbers in garbage time against the Chargers, MSW has underachieved. Week 1 he was shutout against the Broncos and last week versus Philadelphia he caught only two passes for 34 yards. Indianapolis, usually known for disallowing explosive pass plays, was torched by Kyle Orton last week for 476 yards including six completions of 20-plus yards. The Colts' poor performance lends hope for a Sims-Walker rebound. Hoewver, look for the Cover 2 to rediscover its defensive identity. As the Jags\xe2\x80\x99 only dependable downfield weapon, Sims-Walker will draw plenty of attention. In what will likely be a lopsided affair, he could generate appreciable numbers again late, but that\xe2\x80\x99s tough to count on. Keep in mind Indy surrendered only 33 yards to Andre Johnson Week 1 and 35 yards to New York\xe2\x80\x99s Steve Smith the following week. Possible Week 4 WR alternatives: Louis Murphy (vs. Hou), Mark Clayton (vs. Sea), Lance Moore (vs. Car), James Jones (vs. Det), Braylon Edwards (at Buf)"

S'Outgoing single ladies take cover. Big Ben is back. Coming off a four-game suspension for violating the league\xe2\x80\x99s personal conduct policy, the two-time Super Bowl champ is chomping at the bit to see regular season action. Reportedly \xe2\x80\x9cexcited\xe2\x80\x9d about his activation, he should unleash hell on a barkless Chihuahuas secondary which has been exploited often. According to Inside Edge, Cleveland has surrendered 12.3 yards per completion, the third-highest mark in the league. Mangenius\xe2\x80\x99 club has also yielded 1.6 passing touchdowns per game. Roethlisberger has netted a hefty 9.0 yards per attempt in his past four meetings against the Browns, a similar uncorking is quite possible this time around. If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, those in Mike Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s camp will continue to be unhappy, including the receiver. The fettered wideout is aiming to become a bigger part of the offense. Rust might be visible, but we\xe2\x80\x99re confident Big Ben will have plenty of Bondo within arm\xe2\x80\x99s reach.'

S"More loser than bruiser even when healthy this season, PT, much like the Saints collectively, has grossly underachieved. Evident in his 3.2 yards per carry average, wide running lanes have been an oddity. Actually, much to the pleasure of his owners in PPR leagues, Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 value has come via the passing game, which could continue until the offensive line steps up its game. This week is the ideal opportunity for that to happen. Tampa has shown defensive improvement across the board, particularly against the pass. However, the seafaring Bucs still haven\xe2\x80\x99t quite mastered trench warfare. On the season, they\xe2\x80\x99ve allowed 5.3 yards per carry and 165.4 total yards per game to RBs, equal to the 10th-most fantasy points. In order to resolve their offensive imprudence, the Saints must establish a viable ground attack. With Thomas, who\xe2\x80\x99s missed the past two games with a ankle injury, presumably ready to reenter the starting lineup, New Orleans reclaims its ground identity. Assuming he suits up, count on PT as an RB2 in 10-team and deeper formats. (UPDATE: Thomas missed practice Wednesday, jeopardizing his chances of playing in Tampa. If he does indeed sit, we'll score whichever back garners the start for the Saints \xe2\x80\x93 Christopher Ivory, LaDell Betts or, gulp, Julius Jones). "

The Barbarian is no longer much of a threat. This week, \xe2\x80\x9cLivin\xe2\x80\x99 on the Edge\xe2\x80\x9d will be the upstart\xe2\x80\x99s theme song against the Vikings. A week ago, LaDainian Tomlinson was successful running outside the Williams Wall, totaling 94 yards on 20 carries, the third-highest tally surrendered by Minnesota in their past 24 games. Of course, the Dallas offensive line isn\xe2\x80\x99t comparable to the Jets\xe2\x80\x99, but because of Jones\xe2\x80\x99 screeching wheels and versatility, he could post similar marks, especially running left. Backs that have attacked Ray Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 side have averaged a stout 5.8 yards per carry. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be overly concerned with the matchup. The rising star should compile vibrant RB2 totals in Week 6.'

After a tumultuous offseason, it looks as though he\xe2\x80\x99s finally found his stride. This week could be the thoroughbred\xe2\x80\x99s finest effort yet. Wide receivers have performed an astounding 69.1 percent above the league average against the Jags. Because of Jacksonville\xe2\x80\x99s shortcomings in downfield coverage \xe2\x80\x93 it has allowed the most 20-yard pass plays in the league \xe2\x80\x93 the speedy Britt will be the focal point of the Titans offense.

The product from Andy Behrens U (Iowa) actually ranks ahead of well-knowns Visanthe Shiancoe, Tony Gonzalez and Jason Witten in points per game paying a 7.2 weekly dividend in standard formats. Because Dwayne Bowe naturally secretes butter from his hands, Moeaki has become Matt Cassel\xe2\x80\x99s most dependable option boasting a catch rate near 70-percent. Pass coverage, especially against tight ends, has been a major bugaboo for the Texans. Oversized targets have tallied 8.2 receptions and 91.6 yards per game against them, equal to the second-most fantasy points allowed. JerMichael Finley owners frantically searching for a multi-week alternative shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look any further. Moeaki is quickly becoming must start material each and every week."

S"During his brief stint in the league, Brown has been largely undependable. Firmly entrenched behind Joseph Addai, he\xe2\x80\x99s surpassed the century mark in total yards only once in 17 games (including playoffs). Although we don\xe2\x80\x99t expect him to reach triple-digits in yardage, he should net appreciable numbers in D.C. With Addai dinged, Brown, and to a lesser extent Mike Hart, could see an increase in touches this week. Overall, the \xe2\x80\x98Skins have underperformed defensively, particularly against the run. Washington has yielded a hefty 4.6 yards per carry and 166.2 total yards per game to rushers. Due to Indianapolis\xe2\x80\x99 secretive nature, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to gauge how carries will be distributed. But this week our gut says Brown is a good bet for quality flex numbers. (Note: With Brown looking like a casualty for Week 6, we'll score Mike Hart in his place, assuming the Big Ten's all-time leading rusher is active)"

S'Take away his 497-yard, three-touchdown scorgasm Week 2 in Washington, the quarterback with a banker\xe2\x80\x99s face has bankrupted those who invested heavy coin in his services. Schaub\xe2\x80\x99s QB rating against the Giants (53.1) was comparable to Steve-O\xe2\x80\x99s I.Q. With back-to-back sub-200 yard games, his supporters are starting to grow concerned \xe2\x80\x93 rightfully so. The Texans\xe2\x80\x99 more balanced philosophy combined with poor pass protection have sapped the signal caller\xe2\x80\x99s statistical contributions. More of the same should be expected versus KC. After holding Peyton Manning touchdown-less a week ago, the Chiefs travel to H-Town with supreme confidence. In particular, cornerback Brandon Flowers, who will have his hands full defending Andre Johnson, has elevated his game. Look for Romeo Crennel to install a 2-4-5 base defense in an attempt to bewilder another explosive offense. As a result, Schaub may again turn in another Carr-ian performance. Possible QB alternatives: Ben Roethlisberger (vs. Cle), Vince Young (at Jac), Joe Flacco (at NE)'

S'Two weeks ago, Jackson was on the fast-track to legitimizing his Round 1 price tag. The bulldozing back was coming off his third-straight double-digit fantasy performance and the passing attack, spearheaded by a rapidly maturing Sam Bradford, was becoming a real force for defenses to reckon with. How quickly the tide can turn. The season-ending injury to Mark Clayton is a significant blow to the running game. Unless Brandon Gibson, Laurent Robinson or fully healed tight end Michael Hoomanawanui pick up the slack, Jackson will again be confronted with stacked boxes, especially this week against San Diego. Despite a depleted linebacker corps, the Chargers\xe2\x80\x99 3-4 has stuffed the run effectively, limiting opposing rushers to a bland 4.1 yards per carry and the fifth-fewest fantasy points. Undoubtedly, Jackson will get his touches \xe2\x80\x93 he totaled 26 in the Lions\xe2\x80\x99 37-point shellacking a week ago \xe2\x80\x93 but expect a modest return.'

Over the past three weeks, he\xe2\x80\x99s failed to splash the invisible pool, averaging just 75.7 total yards per game. On the road in the Big Apple, Best won\xe2\x80\x99t bear many statistical fruits. The Giants, battered by injuries a season ago, have regained their defensive swagger. Last week, they dominated the line of scrimmage against the Texans, holding NFL ground king Arian Foster to just 25 yards. On the year, the G-Men have surrendered just 3.6 yards per carry and 115 total yards per game to RBs. Possibly minus Calvin Johnson, the Giants will likely devise a blitz-heavy game plan to eliminate Best from the equation. Anticipate yet another bitter-tasting output."

No tender thigh or ineffective passing attack has caged Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s raging bull. The early season sensation has been a model of consistency averaging 15.9 fantasy points per game in standard formats, the sixth-best mark among RBs. However, Colt McCoy and a road clash with Pittsburgh are ingredients for disaster. In order to take pressure off the green QB, Eric Mangini and Brian Daboll are expected to run Hillis into the ground early. But considering the Steelers have allowed just 2.6 yards per carry to rushers, he could post a subterranean return. Throw in the strong likelihood the Browns fall behind early, and Hillis is nothing more than a flex gamble in 12-team PPR formats. Peyton, it\xe2\x80\x99s been an awesome ride.

S"Barely a top 50 receiver in per week production, Colston has become fantasy\xe2\x80\x99s most frustrating illusionist. Call him the Great Fooldini. Without a viable running game, the Saints' once prolific passing attack has turned pedestrian. As a consequence, the on-field vanishing act has averaged just 57.4 yards per game without a touchdown. This week, Colston\xe2\x80\x99s insipid streak will likely continue. Tampa corner Aquib Talib has effectively shackled top targets, including Chad Ochocinco a week ago (3-20-0). He\xe2\x80\x99s also logged a pick in three consecutive games. Due to the rest of the secondary\xe2\x80\x99s limitations, Lance Moore, Robert Meachem and Devery Henderson will be Drew Brees\xe2\x80\x99 flavors of the week. On the year, No. 1 receivers have walked the plank versus the Bucs, averaging a mere 46.2 yards per game. Colston remains an excellent bargain basement buy, but don\xe2\x80\x99t expect a dramatic recovery in Week 6, especially with Pierre Thomas likely sidelined."

S'Kevin Kolb is Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s kryptonite. The elevated backup, who is expected to start in place of injured Michael Vick for the second straight week, has failed to establish even a 14.4 connection with the speedy receiver. Over the past two weeks, Jackson has hauled in only 5 passes for 43 yards. Some insiders blame Kolb\xe2\x80\x99s flaccid arm and lack of patience for the wideout\xe2\x80\x99s underwhelming production. Others, most notably Marty Mornhinweg, have pointed the finger at the enemy. According to the OC, defenders have tailored specific schemes to slow Jackson, jamming him at the line. When freed downfield, he\xe2\x80\x99s also drawn numerous double-teams. The Falcons may implement a similar strategy. On paper, Atlanta is one of the league\xe2\x80\x99s finest pass defenses. The Dirty Birds have yielded the third-fewest 20-yard pass plays. However, matchups against passing patsies Pittsburgh, Arizona, San Francisco and Cleveland have skewed the data. Still, because of Kolb\xe2\x80\x99s infatuation with LeSean McCoy and Brent Celek, Dunta Robinson, who will be isolated on Jackson, may take the day off. Another gut-wrenching performance could be forthcoming.Possible WR alternatives: Kenny Britt (at Jac), Nate Washington (at Jac), Mike Wallace (vs. Cle), Johnny Knox (vs. Sea), Anthony Armstrong (vs. Ind), Danny Amendola (vs. SD), Louis Murphy (at SF), Eddie Royal (vs. NYJ)'

S'If Hollywood producers ever make a horror movie about murderous hillbillies (Possible title: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hillbillies Have Knives\xe2\x80\x9d), Stafford should be cast as the lead role. Seriously, with a pitchfork and scowl he could scare the bejesus out of the most unflappable moviegoer (See profile pic). Sidelined since Week 1 with a separated shoulder, the former top pick declared himself \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d after uncorking a 70-yard bomb in practice on Monday. Based on the friendly matchup, he just might slice and dice the competition. Outside last week\xe2\x80\x99s clinic against Jay Cutler, DeAngelo Hall and cohorts have struggled containing the pass. On the year, signal callers have averaged 306.4 passing yards and 1.4 touchdowns per game and totaled the second-most 20-yard pass plays versus the \xe2\x80\x98Skins. Stafford may be a bit rusty after the extended layoff, but with Calvin Johnson, Nate Burleson and Jahvid Best presumably at or near full strength post-bye he should notch top-10 numbers in his return, especially given Megatron\xe2\x80\x99s 7-inch height advantage over Hall.

S'Plagued by a knee setback and general selfishness, Beanie has deceived investors banking on a breakout season. His 6.4 points per game output in standard formats ranks 45th among rushers, far behind prominent jersey sellers Danny Woodhead, Derrick Ward and Christopher Ivory. However, finally functioning at full capacity, he\xe2\x80\x99s primed for every down work possibly this week and beyond. Ken Whisenhunt hinted Monday Tim Hightower\xe2\x80\x99s severe bout of fumbilitis will not be tolerated. With Max Hall unseasoned and somewhat unhealthy, Wells will likely be the center of the Cards\xe2\x80\x98 game-plan against Tampa. His bruising style should compile large chunks of yards versus a soft-in-the-middle defense. Between the tackles the Bucs have allowed a hefty 5.7 yards per carry. Overall they\xe2\x80\x99ve also yielded the fifth-most fantasy points to rushers. This is the week Beanie finally sheds the \xe2\x80\x9cweenie\xe2\x80\x9d label.'

S'For defenses, keeping up with the supposedly geriatric Jones has been quite a chore. On the season, the 32-year-old back has averaged a potent 4.7 yards per carry and 76.8 rushing yards per game, including consecutive 100-yard, 1-TD performances. Those hoping for a hostile takeover by Jamaal Charles will continue to wait. With his club setting the pace in the AFC West, Todd Haley is in no mood to change the current script. Stated in this space over and over again, the Bills are a disgraceful run defense. Rushers have tallied 4.8 yards per carry, 178.2 total yards per game and seven touchdowns to RBs this year equal to the third-most fantasy points allowed. After this week those who pray exclusively at the alter of the JC of KC will become polytheists. Clearly, there\xe2\x80\x99s more than one rushing God wearing Chiefs red.'

S'From the wreckage, a solitary, faint Hart-beat can be heard in Indianapolis. The still widely available rusher, not Donald Brown, could ignite a rushing attack clinging to life. Earning an extended look prior to the bye due to injuries to Joseph Addai and Donald Brown, Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s all-time leading rusher performed admirably averaging a respectable 4.2 yards per carry on 22 totes. Now with the incumbent sidelined presumably for the next 4-5 weeks, Hart is the Colts rusher to own. Brown is superior athletically, but his mediocre interior running and Anthony Gonzalez-like durability are major slights. Hart\xe2\x80\x99s tough, physical style is better suited for red zone and goal-line duties. Because of Houston\xe2\x80\x99s shortcomings on pass defense, and Peyton Manning\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable success against it (40 TDs in 17 career games), Hart could be presented with a scoring opportunity or two. The Texans have conceded 138.7 total yards per game and seven touchdowns to RBs this year equal to the 10th-most fantasy points. Brian Cushing\xe2\x80\x99s shift to inside linebacker could help, but Houston is largely defenseless against Manning even minus key weapons. Slide Hart into the flex in deeper leagues.'

S'This year\xe2\x80\x99s shoo-in for Comeback Player of the Year will be one of the few individuals exposed to the Black Death who will actually live to tell about it. Over the past two weeks, the leaner and meaner Williams has finally tapped into his first-round potential, grabbing 21 receptions (31 targets) for 210 yards and a touchdown. Clearly the big winner from the Deion Branch trade, the preseason All-Mancrush selection remains one of fantasy\xe2\x80\x99s best kept secrets. Most would argue a date with Nnamdi Asomugha could temporarily blacken the 26-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s breakthrough campaign. Though his yardage totals may suffer, Williams will have opportunities to produce. Asomugha has exclusively shadowed WR1\xe2\x80\x99s more often this year but not for a full 60 minutes. About a quarter of the time he\xe2\x80\x99s dropped back into zone coverage allowing quarterbacks to seize the moment. Larry Fitzgerald and Michael Crabtree each reeled in touchdown strikes when such a scheme was employed. Expect Williams to do the same. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of the matchup. The virtual game\xe2\x80\x99s fastest rising star should again shine.'

S'Surprisingly, a tertiary contributor could be the difference in the battle for green superiority. With Donald Driver hobbled a week ago versus Minnesota, Jones turned in one of his finest efforts as a pro snagging four passes for 107 yards (eight targets). The fourth-year weapon, an excellent blend of size and speed, could again receive plentiful targets against a Jets defense bolstered by a fully healed Darrelle Revis. The shutdown corner\xe2\x80\x99s presence sticking Greg Jennings combined with Antonio Cromartie\xe2\x80\x99s likely draw of Driver means Jones could square off against talented, but undersized rookie Kyle Wilson. Expect the receiver to have the upper-hand. WR3\xe2\x80\x99s have averaged 67.0 yards per game against New York this season. Combine that with the Jets\xe2\x80\x99 propensity for surrendering explosive pass plays \xe2\x80\x93 they rank ninth in most 20-yard connections allowed \xe2\x80\x93 and the Packers\xe2\x80\x99 long-bomb specialist could again detonate.'

Saying Tony Romo is \xe2\x80\x9cjust as good\xe2\x80\x9d as Kitna is equivalent to comparing Reese\xe2\x80\x99s Peanut Butter Cups to these revolting Halloween treats. But for one week only Big Roy\xe2\x80\x99s talent assessment skills may actually be spot on. The well-traveled veteran has proven occasionally useful in previous stints with the \xe2\x80\x98Hawks, Bengals and Lions. However, his affinity for holding onto the football and sailing passes are major downsides. If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t release quickly, he could get killed standing behind a rickety offensive line. Still, with nuclear weapons galore around him, he should prove viable against meek competition. Jacksonville is one such opponent. Quarterbacks of all shapes and sizes have burned the Jaguars often this season, tallying a ridiculous 8.9 yards per attempt. Jack Del Rio\xe2\x80\x99s club has also conceded the most 20-yard pass plays and second-most fantasy points to signal callers. How Mr. Clean waxes the Jags won\xe2\x80\x99t be pretty, but his end-game totals will undoubtedly sparkle. Confidently plug him in Matt Ryan, Jay Cutler, Eli Manning and Joe Flacco owners.'

S'More of a gentle Brees than a howling wind, the reigning Super Bowl MVP has largely been a fantasy disappointment this season. Through seven games, he\xe2\x80\x99s thrown 10 picks, one less than he did all of last year, and has averaged an uncharacteristic 7.1 yards per attempt (8.5 YPA in \xe2\x80\x9909). As Cleveland proved a week ago, defenses have pressured Brees successfully, limiting opportunities downfield. Reggie Bush\xe2\x80\x99s continued absence hurts, but the Saints really miss the interior toughness of Pierre Thomas. Christopher Ivory has been effective in spurts, but his inconsistency is an ongoing problem. Unless the backfield overcomes its inadequacies, the Steel Curtain will prove impenetrable, creating a hellish situation for New Orleans\xe2\x80\x99 passing game. Understand over the past 19 games with Troy Polamalu in uniform, a period stretching back to 2008, the Steelers have not allowed a multi-TD passer. Charlie Browns who ring Brees\xe2\x80\x99 bell Halloween night will likely get served a rock. Possible QB alternatives: Jon Kitna (vs. Jac), Carson Palmer (vs. Mia), Matthew Stafford (vs. Was), Ryan Fitzpatrick (at KC)'

S'Watching Benson accumulate stats over the course of a game is slow torture. Nearly 23-percent of his carries have gone for zero or negative yards, well above the 18.9-percent league average. Frankly, he\xe2\x80\x99s only useful due to sheer volume. On the season, he\xe2\x80\x99s compiled a mediocre 3.9 yards per carry and 86.8 total yards per game. More discouraging, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t crossed the chalk since Week 3. Outside Benson\xe2\x80\x99s mundane play, the Bengals offense as a whole has performed admirably. However, Carson Palmer\xe2\x80\x99s unbreakable chemistry with Terrell Owens, Chad Ochocinco and Jermaine Gresham inside the red-zone has discounted the rusher\xe2\x80\x99s overall fantasy worth. Don\xe2\x80\x99t expect the script to change in Week 8. The \xe2\x80\x98Fins have controlled the line of scrimmage for much of the season, holding rushers to just 3.9 yards per carry and 116.7 total yards per game. Because they\xe2\x80\x99ve conceded 7.6 yards per attempt to QBs this year, Palmer\xe2\x80\x99s arm, not Benson\xe2\x80\x99s legs, will be the appendage Marvin Lewis leans on most.'

S"Moreno was the lone silver lining for the Broncos in last week\xe2\x80\x99s Mile High massacre at the hands of the suddenly fearsome Oakland Raiders. His 90 total yards and two receiving touchdowns firmly planted him inside the position's top 10 for the week. However, a trip to the Land of Jacked Up Teeth (England) doesn\xe2\x80\x99t inspire much hope for a repeat performance. The Gold Panners have limited opposing rushers to just 3.4 yards per carry. Because of the Tebow factor, Josh McDaniels\xe2\x80\x99 pass-happy ways and the Niners\xe2\x80\x99 struggles in downfield coverage, Moreno will likely log a light workload. He may carve out a substantial role in the passing attack, but this game sets up nicely for Kyle Orton to chuck it up 40-plus times. Recall in four games this season he\xe2\x80\x99s eclipsed 15 carries in a game only once, averaging a wretched 3.3 yards per tote. Cue the Benny Hill music. (In London)"

S'Owners who drafted Mathews would gladly accept a Jack Torrance axe to the jugular to end their collective misery. The popular first-round pick was benched last week in favor of the more experienced/versatile Darren Sproles. Norv Turner cited the veteran\xe2\x80\x99s ability to protect and run effective routes as the reason for Mathews\xe2\x80\x99 demotion. Another frustrating effort is slated for Sunday. Tennessee has plugged gaps vigorously this season, holding rushers to just 3.7 yards per carry, 112.6 total yards per game and three touchdowns equal to the third-fewest fantasy points. Rashard Mendenhall and Maurice Jones-Drew are just a couple marquee backs who were shackled by the Titans earlier this year. However, despite their stiffness up front, Jeff Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s bunch has conceded ample yards to RBs through the air. Sproles, not Mathews, could again be leaned on to move the chains. Mike Tolbert\xe2\x80\x99s recurring role at the goal-line further muddies the situation. This won\xe2\x80\x99t be the week the rookie wards off the evil fantasy spirits. Possible RB alternatives: Ryan Torain (at Det), Marshawn Lynch (at Oak), Thomas Jones (vs. Buf), Beanie Wells (vs. TB), Mike Hart (vs. Hou), LeGarrette Blount (at Ari)'

S'Still adjusting to life in the post-Moss era, Welker, whose target has clearly widened over the past two weeks, has found little breathing room. Added defensive attention to the slippery receiver\xe2\x80\x99s side has turned Tom Brady\xe2\x80\x99s attention toward Deion Branch and Aaron Hernandez, stealing valuable underneath targets that would normally be intended for No. 83. In fact, over the past two weeks Branch has attracted 20 looks, Welker 17. Even when the crafty wideout has escaped coverage minimal yardage gains have been tallied. He\xe2\x80\x99s yet to eclipse 75 yards in a game this season. Clearly, he still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite regained the explosiveness seen in years past. Despite key injuries on defense, the Purple People Eaters have consumed wide receivers. Only one WR, James Jones in Week 7, has reached the 75-yard mark against them. Overall, pass catchers are performing 10.3 percent below the league average versus the Vikes. Obviously, Welker can\xe2\x80\x99t be demoted in PPR formats, but in standard shallow leagues he deserves to ride the pine.'

Though they\xe2\x80\x99ve played a relatively soft schedule, the Chargers are officially a legit pass defense. Last week, Tom Brady recorded just 159 yards and a TD against them. Antoine Cason bounced back strong last week after a dreadful performance in St. Louis. Britt has a slight height advantage on the third-year corner, but expect Cason to win the physical battle. Only two wide receivers have surpassed 60 yards against the Chargers this season. Yes, maybe we need to attend Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s Rally to Restore Sanity. After all, Britt has splashed pay-dirt seven times in his past five games. But this week with Vince Young once again behind center he comes crashing back down to reality. Hey, as Brett Favre may soon realize, all legendary streaks eventually come to an end. Possible WR alternatives: Mike Williams, Sea (at Oak), Mike Williams, TB (at Ari), James Jones (at NYJ), Dez Bryant (vs. Jac), Steve Johnson (at KC)"

S'Through the first two weeks, yards have been plentiful for Mcnabb. The end zone, however, has been elusive. Despite throwing for 597 yards, including a ridiculous 426 yards versus Houston, he\xe2\x80\x99s connected for six just one time. Expect a multi-TD effort in Week 3. Washington and Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s receiving arsenals may be interchangeable, but McNabb should storm out of the gates similar to how Bruce Gradkowski finished against the Rams a week ago. Due to the potential absences of starting corners Justin King and Kevin Dockery, Mike Shanahan will likely construct a game-plan centered on the passing game. The St. Louis D, which has allowed a healthy 7.0 yards per attempt and 248.5 passing yards per game, is aerially challenged. Give up 297 yards to Derek Anderson and you deserve such a label. Throw in Clinton Portis\xe2\x80\x99s inability to run through a statue comprised of Cool Whip (3.1 ypc), and it\xe2\x80\x99s clear McNabb will be leaned on heavily. Consider the vet a top-10 QB play on the road.'

S'To the casual viewer, a matchup against the vaunted Jets would seem highly unattractive. After all, despite not having hole plunger Kris Jenkins last week, they limited the Pats to just 2.6 yards per carry. However, if you think they will dominate the trenches again, keep slugging back the banana daiquiris alongside Braylon Edwards. Darrelle Revis\xe2\x80\x99s absence puts enormous pressure on the makeshift defensive line. Chad Henne will undoubtedly target Brandon Marshall downfield in an attempt to create favorable opportunities for what Miami does best: pounding opponents into submission. If the passing game clicks, Ricky and Ronnie will be devastating. Remember, even with Revis in uniform a year ago, the Fins thumped their division rival on the ground at home, totaling 151 rushing yards and two touchdowns (Ronnie Brown: 21-74-2, Ricky: 11-68, 3-70). In front of a raucous crowd and a national TV audience, the Holistic One massages the Jets to sleep. Expect the unexpected.'

S'Spawned from a prehistoric encounter between Harriet Tubman and a T-Rex, Taylor is seriously old. Still, despite his eroding skill set and cemented spot in a tough-to-read running back rotation, he occasionally surprises (e.g. 14-71-0 Week 1). This week could be one of those moments. Kevin Faulk\xe2\x80\x99s knee injury should temporarily vault the 34-year-old back into the fantasy spotlight. Similar to last season, the Bills have rolled out the red carpet for opposing rushers, conceding 128.5 total yards per game. In what will likely become a lopsided affair, Taylor and BenJarvus Green-Ellis could net a sizable workload salting away the clock. Out to prove he can \xe2\x80\x9cstill play ball,\xe2\x80\x9d look for the antique back to post solid flex numbers in 12-team and deeper leagues.'

S"Beanie\xe2\x80\x99s surly reputation as a fantasy weenie continues to get plumper with each passing week. Looking more and more like a Week 3 casualty, the second-year back has yet to earn the confidence of Ken Whisenhunt. Regardless if Wells trots out of the tunnel in 'Zona's home opener, Hightower will start and produce. In reality, the third-year back has played somewhat unimpressively over the first two weeks. However, in fantasy terms he\xe2\x80\x99s been an unsung hero racking 218 total yards and two touchdowns. He\xe2\x80\x99s also averaged a ridiculous 7.0 yards per carry. Per usual, the Raiders\xe2\x80\x99 run defense is meek. The Crypt Keeper\xe2\x80\x99s band of hornless devils has surrendered 4.7 yards per carry, 156 total yards per game and three scores to rushers. With Nnamdi Asomugha draped all over Larry Fitzgerald, Hightower will be deployed early and often to establish an offensive rhythm. Provided he squeezes the rock, a top-15 RB performance is very likely."

S'A season ago, Royal was fantasy\xe2\x80\x99s indisputable king of pain at wide receiver. Horrifically underused, he experienced a dramatic drop-off in targets, receptions and yards. Determined to regain his regal form, the third-year wideout extensively studied film on Wes Welker over the offseason in hopes of becoming the AFC\xe2\x80\x99s next slot machine. So far his hard work has paid off. Targeted a team-high 15 times, he\xe2\x80\x99s hauled in 13 receptions for 163 yards and a touchdown. The emergence of Demaryius Thomas could slightly diminish his production down the road, but this week against the Colts he will be heavily featured. Because of the umbrella nature of the Cover 2, voids are often created underneath, an area where Royal typically thrives. Thomas may be the latest \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x9d receiver, but his slippery teammate is the more trustworthy option to start this week.'

In the battle for the Yellow Rose, another appreciable line should be accumulated. Last week, Dallas boosted the already gargantuan ego of Jay Cutler allowing 277 yards and three touchdowns. With Pro Bowl corner Mike Jenkins dinged, Matt Schaub should operate uninhibitedly. Dallas has yielded the second-most 20-yard pass plays thus far. Considering the numerous double-teams Andre Johnson will attract, the dependable Walter will clean up in the short-to-intermediate field. Count on him as a high-end WR3 in 10-team and deeper leagues.'

This week against a Washington secondary still licking its wounds after surrendering 497 yards and three scores to Schaub, the beaver-toothed youngster will likely gnaw on the visitors. The \xe2\x80\x98Skins have allowed a QB-friendly 7.8 yards per attempt. Taking advantage of what the defense will give him, Bradford will take several shots downfield. Provided the Rams offensive line can protect the prized QB adequately, he should convert on at least a handful of those opportunities. To the five St. Louis fans in attendance, relax, Spags will remove the manacles this week. More desirable than Carson Palmer (at Car) and Joe Flacco (vs. Cle) in Week 3, tab the rook a borderline starter in 12-team leagues.'

S'Congratulations Brett! Your consolation prize in the Vincent Jackson sweepstakes \xe2\x80\xa6 the dude who knocked up the well-endowed, ditzy blonde form "The Girls Next Door." Unable to wrest away the disgruntled V-Jax from SoCal purgatory, the Vikings are a sinking ship offensively. Outside Visanthe Shiancoe, chemistry issues continue to plague the Old Gunslinger. Through two games he\xe2\x80\x99s found the end zone just once and has completed an appalling 58.7 percent of his passes. Normally, a date with the Hello Kitties is the ideal remedy for any passing sickness, particularly for Favre. In his illustrious career, he\xe2\x80\x99s lit up Detroit tossing 51 touchdown passes in 30 games. However, possibly minus Percy Harvin, whose badly bruised hip and resurfaced migraines are likely to keep him out of action, shoddy route runner Bernard Berrian as the No. 1 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t inspire hope for a turnaround. The forty-something told the AP earlier this week \xe2\x80\x9cYou go down swinging and you win swinging,\xe2\x80\x9d Unfortunately, even against an awful Lions secondary which has allowed a very generous 328 passing yards per game, Favre will look like Mark Reynolds. Maybe the Silver Slinger should\xe2\x80\x99ve taken the million bucks to exterminate his trademark gray hair after all. Right now, he\xe2\x80\x99s looking way over-the-hill.'

S'The ballyhooed rookie admitted on Wednesday he\xe2\x80\x99s currently dealing with a high ankle sprain, but remains stedfast he will start despite missing practice time. Regardless if he suits up, Mathews is completely avoidable in Week 3. Seattle is a different defensive animal at QWest Field. Beat down by the Broncos in Denver last week, the \xe2\x80\x98Hawks surrendered 118 total yards and a score to Knowshon Moreno. However, in friendly surroundings, the story will be very different. In an attempt to exploit Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s primary defensive weakness, its secondary, Norv Turner will likely feature the run early, an appealing scenario for Mathews owners. However, sporting a reshuffled defensive line, Pete Carroll\xe2\x80\x99s crew has limited backs to just 2.1 yards per carry on the young season. More discouraging, only one visiting rusher, Chris Johnson, has surpassed the century mark against the \xe2\x80\x98Hawks over their past 11 home games. Toss in Mike Tolbert\xe2\x80\x99s cemented role as goal-line gremlin, and the popular first-round pick will likely be unplugged. Danger, danger, low voltage. (Note: If Mathews is unable to go, the performances of Tolbert/Darren Sproles will be scored).  '

S'Against a hungry 49ers club desperately searching for its first win, the JC of KC will not be a Week 3 savior. Todd Haley, the Judas of fantasy, apologized to virtual managers earlier this week about the ongoing timeshare between Charles and Thomas Jones, stating he has a \xe2\x80\x9cclear-cut plan in of how we will do things with each guy.\xe2\x80\x9d Don\xe2\x80\x99t expect the coach to stray away from the current scheme this week. Running down the throat of Patrick Willis and company has been a fruitless endeavor so far this year. Through two weeks, the Gold Panners have given up just 2.7 yards per carry to rushers. To fully utilize Charles\xe2\x80\x99 home run-hitting speed, Haley will likely call his number often on short swings and dumps, still making the terribly underused back a solid PPR play. However, due to his expected 12-17 touches and daunting matchup, he can\xe2\x80\x99t be trusted in standard formats. Clearly, Haley\xe2\x80\x99s shenanigans are ruining one of the game\xe2\x80\x99s most explosive talents.'

S'No garlic, witchcraft or strange costumes will help Fitz ward off the Black Death, Derek Anderson Nnamdi Asomugha. Not on the same page as Anderson, the decorated wideout has posted an uncharacteristic 37.1 catch percentage through two games. His 9.3 fantasy points per game output in standard formats is respectable, but not exactly what owners who invested heavy coin into the two-time Pro Bowler bargained for. Save for Darrelle Revis, Asomugha is arguably the best cover corner in the league. Unlike a year ago when he was shifted around in an attempt to create confusion, the pesky Raider has remained fixed on the opposition\xe2\x80\x99s top target. Combine that with Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive blitzing approach, and Fitz could easily accumulate mediocre numbers. Damn you and your Viennese Waltz, Kurt Warner.'

Because it\xe2\x80\x99s the rookie\xe2\x80\x99s first game as a starter and against a prowling Bengals defense which picked off Joe Flacco four times a week ago, Smith could fade into the fantasy background. Cincy has tallied just one sack through two games, but Marvin Lewis will attack the pocket in an attempt to rattle Clausen\xe2\x80\x99s cage. Smith is a slippery target who can find and exploit coverage voids in a variety of ways, but due to the Bengals\xe2\x80\x99 bracket scheme he will garner plenty of attention. Unless the green QB suddenly parties like Steve Beuerlein \xe2\x80\x9999, it could be a quiet afternoon for the elite receiver. Keep in mind, the Bengals did not allow a wideout to surpass 70-yards against the Patriots and Ravens.'

S'Historically, the consistency king\xe2\x80\x99s value has driven off the cliff against the Bears. In 19 clashes versus the archrival, Driver has crossed the chalk only twice and recorded an unappealing 3.7 receptions and 48.7 yards per game. Though unable to contain Miles Austin last week, as a whole, Chicago has played brilliantly on defense over the first two weeks. The new Monsters of the Midway will have their hands full against Aaron Rodgers, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve bottled him up before. Recall the last time A-Rod ventured into the Windy City, he posted his worst fantasy performance of 2009 (16-24, 180 yards, 0 TDs, FL). Attention drawn to JerMichael Finley has generated more opportunities for Driver, but the Bears Cover 2, as it seemingly always does, will once again keep Driver in the garage. Austin Collie (at Den), Mark Clayton (vs. Was) and Louis Murphy (at Ari) are wiser WR3 choices.'

S'At the beginning of the season, Kolb was a delectable item on the fantasy menu. Behind center of an explosive, pass-first offense, he was expected to make a Matt Schaub-like rise to stardom. However, a concussion Week 1 versus Green Bay scrambled those thoughts, elevating Michael Vick back to fantasy prominence. Now with Vick sidelined for at least the next 1-2 weeks, the pendulum has swung back to the preseason sleeper\xe2\x80\x99s side. For those who reinvested, expect a massive Week 5 windfall. With LeSean McCoy inactive or extremely limited, Marty Mornhinweg could abandon the run almost entirely in San Francisco, a strategy he implemented often last year. By game\xe2\x80\x99s end, Kolb\xe2\x80\x99s arm may scream for mercy. The Niners are a vulnerable pass defense giving up 236.8 passing yards and two touchdowns per game to QBs equal to the seventh-most fantasy points allowed. Look for Kolb to dink and dunk his way to sizable numbers on 40-plus attempts. Slather him in butter.'

S"Owners searching for a religious experience must start the JC of KC this week at Indy. Charles, shackled for much of the early season averaging just 11.3 carries per game, has been a frustrating player to own. Investors who burned stacks of cash to acquire his services are understandably irate over the runner\xe2\x80\x99s mismanagement. To them, Todd Haley\xe2\x80\x99s head should be forcefully dunked in BBQ sauce until he agrees to increase the dynamic rusher's reps. After all, he\xe2\x80\x99s averaging an insane 7.0 yards per carry. Stay the course. Eventually his per game touches will increase, which could happen this week. Rushers have regularly trampled over the Colts\xe2\x80\x99 undersized defensive line. On the year, Indy has surrendered 4.9 yards per carry, 158.3 total yards per game and five scores to plowshares. Expect Haley to subscribe to a run-first, run-often philosophy in an attempt to control clock and keep the ball out of Peyton Manning\xe2\x80\x99s hands. In Week 5, the JC of KC heals early season wounds."

S"Tolbert is an absolute hammer. More Stanley than Fisher Price, which Ryan Mathews resembles, his thick frame and bone-crushing style and versatility are eerily similar to Natrone Means circa \xe2\x80\x9994. Norv Turner is \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted\xe2\x80\x9d to the rookie as his starter but he clearly believes Mathews and Tolbert are interchangeable. Last week, the veteran\xe2\x80\x99s early hot-hand combined with the Chargers\xe2\x80\x99 quick thrashing of Arizona explained the separation in carries. This week, a similar scenario could play out. The Raiders' frontline has been steamrolled regularly this season. Through four weeks, they\xe2\x80\x99ve conceded the most 20-yard run plays in the league and the third-most fantasy points to RBs, allowing 5.5 yards per carry, 186.7 total yards per game and six touchdowns. Due to the presence of Nnamdi Asomugha, Turner will undoubtedly stress the run. Both Bolts are capable of top-15 performances. But with Mathews still dinged, the undrafted former Chanticleer is the more employable option. Count on a strong RB2 return in 10-team and deeper leagues."

S'Torain is the latest in a long line of unheralded Shanahan running back pets. More Rottweiler than poodle, he\xe2\x80\x99s a classic power back reminiscent of Christian Okoye. He runs a bit upright which could lead to future nicks and scrapes, but against even the stiffest defenses he will gain chunks of yards with every carry. The Eagles\xe2\x80\x99 Quintin Mikell most certainly agrees. The safety was flattened by the Torain train last week (See trucking here). Green Bay is one of the league\xe2\x80\x99s finest run defenses surrendering only 3.8 yards per carry and 102.8 total yards per game to RBs. Within the 3-4 scheme, Packers linebackers attack and buckle running lanes very quickly. However, with Clinton Portis out, opportunities alone suggest Torain will generate upper-tiered RB2 numbers. Keep in mind the burly back has averaged 4.6 yards per carry through two games. Green Bay hasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed a 100-yard rusher in 17 straight regular season contests, but the \xe2\x80\x98Skins\xe2\x80\x99 punisher just might end the streak.'

S'Manningham will go so deep, so deep, he\xe2\x80\x99ll put Houston butts to sleep. Shutout last week against Chicago, the fleet-footed wideout will be heavily involved in Tom Coughlin\xe2\x80\x99s Week 5 game-plan. The Texans success stymieing the run and severe deficiencies on pass defense means Eli Manning will bombard them often downfield. Houston has yielded the third-most 20-yard pass plays and the fifth-most fantasy points to wideouts this year. Manningham, who has averaged 17.0 yards per catch, will likely attract at least 7-8 targets. Brian Cushing\xe2\x80\x99s return from suspension is a significant boost, but his short-field presence is a bigger issue for Steve Smith and Ahmad Bradshaw owners. Sunday will be a good day for Super Mario.'

S'Amendola, classically trained at the Wes Welker Institute of Overachievement while a student at Texas Tech, has emerged as a viable deep-league PPR commodity. Currently ranked in the top 20 in targets (7.8) and receptions per game (5.3), the undrafted wideout has reeled in at least four catches in each of his first four games, including a ridiculous Cirque du Soleil-esque grab last week versus Seattle (See the circus catch here). Once again, the Hello Kitties have struggled mightily in almost every facet defensively, particularly against the pass. Unable to contain receivers whether in zone or man coverage they\xe2\x80\x99ve surrendered the 10th-most fantasy points to WRs this season. Amendola is a precise route-runner who has become Sam Bradford\xe2\x80\x99s most trusted ally underneath. Due to the nature of his game, explosive pass plays are a rarity, but a season-best effort appears to be imminent. Additional contributions on special teams increases the odds. With Welker enjoying a little robe time this week, another former Red Raider will storm the field with \xe2\x80\x9cGuns Up.\xe2\x80\x9d Slot him in as a WR3 in 12-team and deeper leagues.'

Jacksonville\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassing secondary ranks first in most 20-yard pass plays and fantasy points allowed to QBs. Through a quarter of the season, it\xe2\x80\x99s yielded 315 yards per game and nine touchdowns. Last week in a blowout loss to the Jets, Fitzpatrick did his best Vick impersonation throwing for 128 yards and two touchdowns while also racking 74 rushing yards. Despite a solid fantasy output, he completed only 12 of 27 attempts, a performance so poor Chan Gailey nearly benched him. As a result, the signal caller acknowledged Monday he and his receivers \xe2\x80\x9cneed to get on the same page.\xe2\x80\x9d Against the woeful Jags, look for the Bills to get synergized.

S'Rivers has raged in the early season ranking only behind Peyton Manning in points per week. His relationship with Antonio Gates is borderline disturbing. The dynamic duo is the true superhero combination in the AFC. Taking more chances downfield \xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99s averaged 9.4 yards per attempt \xe2\x80\x93 he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t skipped a beat sans disgruntled Vincent Jackson. Yes, the crow has been difficult to swallow, but at least the Frank\xe2\x80\x99s hot sauce has masked the bitter flavor. In the Black Hole a more peaceful, tranquil Rivers will flow. Last season in two games against the Raiders, the Chargers passer averaged a bland 250.5 yards, one touchdown and one interception per game. Because of Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s inadequacies versus the run and due to the respect for Nnamdi Asomugha, a heavy one-two punch of Mike Tolbert and Ryan Mathews should be expected. Keep in mind the Raiders have surrendered only 158.8 passing yards per game this season. Dip your oar somewhere else. Possible QB alternatives: Sam Bradford (at Det), Shaun Hill (vs. StL), Kevin Kolb (at SF), Ryan Fitzpatrick (vs. Jac), Matt Ryan (at Cle)'

S'Over the years when Peterson has been mentioned in this space he\xe2\x80\x99s stepped up to the challenge and obliterated single-game rushing records. However, as Chris Johnson owners can attest, any player, no matter how talented, is susceptible to a dud game or two. For the Purple Jesus, Week 5 will be one such rare occasion. Every week a running back has rubbed jerseys with the Jets, he\xe2\x80\x99s contacted gangrene. Ray Rice and Ronnie Brown both experienced the infection\xe2\x80\x99s insufferable wrath earlier this year totaling a meager 97 yards on 32 carries (3.0 ypc). The acquisition of Randy Moss will undoubtedly curtail stacked boxes, but with the Jets now at full strength defensively containing Peterson is the No. 1 priority. Even minus man-eater Kris Jenkins, New York has surrendered the fewest fantasy points to rushers this season. Unless an owner is gifted extraordinary alternatives (e.g. Peyton Hillis or Mike Tolbert), entertaining the idea of sitting one of the league\xe2\x80\x99s premier backs is a silly risk. Still, the Jets are a constricting defense which is very capable of squeezing Peterson. The Noise may be Christine O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell loony (Full disclosure: We\xe2\x80\x99ve also dabbled in witchcraft, solely for the brew) but an All-Day letdown is within the realm of possibility.'

S"Eerily similar to his slow start a season ago, the incognito Rice has yet to arrive in 2010. A burdensome early season slate and a tender knee have halted his production. Currently the 31st-best back in Fantasyland, he\xe2\x80\x99s yet to cross the chalk, averaging a mediocre 76 total yards per game. Back close to full strength, he's expected to start and should show more explosiveness this week against Denver. However, despite the increased workload, owners should temper expectations. The Broncos trampled Chris Johnson a week ago holding the superstar rusher to 53 yards on 19 carries. On the season, no running back has broken the plane against them. Overall, Denver has conceded the second-fewest fantasy points to RBs. Better days are on the horizon for the exorbitant back (e.g. New England and Buffalo in Weeks 6 and 7). After another disappointing effort this will be your last chance to buy on the bear."

Though currently ranked as a strong RB2, Forte has yet to eclipse 3.0 yards per carry in any single game this season. His production has come exclusively through the air. Despite the ground game\xe2\x80\x99s state of disrepair, Lovie Smith remains \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted\xe2\x80\x9d to it. However, don't expect a sudden turnaround this week in Carolina. The Panthers run defense demands respect. So far, it's conceded just 3.3 yards per carry to backs this season. No rusher has yet to surpass 85 rushing yards against it. John Fox\xe2\x80\x99s club has struggled getting to the quarterback, but if Jon Beason and friends can successfully turn up the heat on Jay Cutler Todd Collins, Forte\xe2\x80\x99s receiving contributions could again be limited. Baby\xe2\x80\x99s mama drama and a smack-down in New York; it\xe2\x80\x99s been a great past few days for Forte. Until the running game rises from the grave, trust someone else.

S'For those who believed the T.O. show was on the brink of cancellation, Week 4 was a reminder ratings are still strong. Captivating fanatical audiences against Buckeye State rival Cleveland, Owens hauled in 10 receptions for 222 yards and a touchdown becoming the oldest receiver in NFL history to eclipse the 200-yard mark. The encore will be unremarkable. Prior to last week\xe2\x80\x99s explosion, T.O. hadn\xe2\x80\x99t reached 60 yards in a game. The workload is attractive \xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99s averaged 12 targets per game, the second-highest tally in the league \xe2\x80\x93 but last week\xe2\x80\x99s spectacular showing was an anomaly. Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s Aquib Talib is a rising star who head coach Raheem Morris believes could soon enter the Revis, Asomugha, and Bailey class of corners. If he shadows Owens, the veteran could walk the plank. Remember only one wide receiver has surpassed the 70-yard mark against the Bucs this year. Change the channel.'

S'Poor Larry. No receiver, no matter how talented or hydrated, can survive in Arizona. Once a fertile crescent of fantasy production under Kurt Warner\xe2\x80\x99s direction, the desert has become a desolate statistical wasteland. Derek Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s inability to hit the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man from 10-yards out has sullied the two-time Pro Bowlers reputation. With rookie Max Hall now at the helm, a rapid recovery isn\xe2\x80\x99t likely. Aggressive Saints DC Gregg Williams is surely licking his chops. Because of Hall\xe2\x80\x99s inexperience, he will undoubtedly crumble under the blitz barrage. Due to the green QB\xe2\x80\x99s expected troubles and considering only one receiver has tallied 70-plus yards against New Orleans this season, Fitzgerald will likely vanish once again. Seek out other options even in 12-team leagues. Possible WR alternatives: Lee Evans (vs. Jac), Steve Johnson (vs. Jac), Lance Moore (at Ari), Mario Manningham (at Hou), Danny Amendola (at Det), James Jones (at Was), Santonio Holmes (vs. Min)'

S'Local media in North Georgia recently compared Ryan to Tom Brady and Peyton Manning. His \xe2\x80\x9cspecial\xe2\x80\x9d set of physical skills and coolness in adverse situations explain why the Falcons are atop the standings in the NFC. But against one of the league\xe2\x80\x99s hottest defenses, Matty Ice will melt under the pressure. Hardly touched this season, Ryan has been sacked only 15 times, the third-lowest mark in the league. Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s offensive line has done a tremendous job protecting its cherished leader. Green Bay, however, is a different animal. Led by Skid Row groupie Clay Matthews, the Packers are a dogged, pocket-collapsing bunch. Only two QBs have registered multi-TD efforts against them. They\xe2\x80\x99ve also held passers to just 6.5 yards per attempt and 230 yards per game. Ryan has scorched in recent weeks connecting for 11 TD passes in his past five contests. This week, though, his fiery hand will be extinguished. Other QB alternatives: Shaun Hill (vs. NE), Eli Manning (vs. Jax), Jon Kitna (vs. NO)\xe2\x80\xa8'

S'Unfortunately for the Oompa Loompa, no chocolate rivers flow through the new Meadowlands. Outside Week 3 against Chris Johnson and last week versus LeSean McCoy, the Giants have dominated the trenches. On the season, they\xe2\x80\x99ve yielded 3.9 yards per carry, 111.2 total yards per game and six scores to rushers, equal to the fifth-fewest fantasy points. MJD\xe2\x80\x99s burrowing nature is generally problematic for most defenses. But unless David Garrard, minus top weapon Mike Sims-Walker, can keep the G-Men honest, reinforcements will creep regularly into the box in an attempt to stuff the run. More importantly, the Jags defense must rise to the occasion. In Jacksonville\xe2\x80\x99s four losses, the tree-trunked back has averaged just 80.8 total yards per game with one touchdown. MoJo has been on a tear over the past three weeks, eclipsing the century mark in each game. But this week against an aggressive Giants defense, the candyman won\xe2\x80\x99t.'

S'Though few would ever recognize it, Moreno has performed at an RB1 level this season. In seven games, he\xe2\x80\x99s quietly averaged 14.5 points per week in standard formats, the ninth-best line at his position. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to overlook the second-year back\xe2\x80\x99s valuable contributions. Denver\xe2\x80\x99s pass-first system has launched Kyle Orton and Brandon Lloyd into the statistical stratosphere. Expect the aerial tandem to be the point of emphasis in Josh McDaniels\xe2\x80\x99 game-plan this week. Due to the Rams\xe2\x80\x99 stiffness up front, the Broncos will bombard their opponent. Rushers have performed 12-percent below the league average against St. Louis this season. RB runs versus the Rams have also gone for zero or negative yards 20.4-percent of the time, the sixth-best tally in the NFC. St. Louis is exploitable on the peripheries, especially in the short-field. Backs have reeled in 5.7 receptions per game against it. That vulnerability could lead Moreno to excellent totals in PPR leagues. However, he could disappoint in standard leagues. Saddle another horse. Other RB alternatives: Danny Woodhead (at Det), Mike Tolbert (at Ind), Keiland Williams (vs. Min), Mike Goodson (at Cle)'

S'For Cincinnati\xe2\x80\x99s surprisingly passive side of its wideout Reality Show, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a season filled with high ratings. At an age when most receivers are scouting out golf-friendly retirement communities, Owens continues to rack prime-worthy numbers. His 13.8 points per week output ranks behind only Brandon Lloyd and Roddy White. But last year\xe2\x80\x99s unanimous choice for MVT (Most Valueless Turkey) could be basted by Darrelle Revis and Antonio Cromartie. According to Rex Ryan, the Jets\xe2\x80\x99 dynamic coverage duo will split time blanketing Owens, though Revis, who T.O. deemed \xe2\x80\x9can average corner,\xe2\x80\x9d will likely take on the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share. Since The Island reopened for business in Week 8, vacationing receivers have been lost at sea. During that span, No. 1 targets, including Calvin Johnson, Andre Johnson and Greg Jennings, have averaged a lowly 3.3 receptions and 33.5 yards per game against the Jets. Due to the pair\xe2\x80\x99s restrictive coverage, tight ends and slot receivers have had seen an increased workload versus New York. Jermaine Gresham and Jordan Shipley\xe2\x80\x99s roles could expand this week. Owens\xe2\x80\x99 revival has been nothing short of spectacular, but, this week, his feathers get plucked. Avoid the leftovers.'

Over his past five games, the Mizzou product has eclipsed 12 points or more in standard leagues three times, including a nine-catch, 120-yard effort against the rival Giants in Week 11. Blessed with blinding speed, he is one of the game\xe2\x80\x99s rising stars. However, Chicago is no pushover defensively. Ferocious versus the pass, the Bears have given up a league low 6.0 yards per attempt and the third-fewest 20-yard pass plays. More discouraging, only four receivers have surpassed the 75-yard mark against the Midway Monsters this year. Vick\xe2\x80\x99s downfield efficiency has been extraordinary, but the Bears\xe2\x80\x99 relentless pass rush and suffocating Cover 2 will sap explosive pass plays, and Maclin\xe2\x80\x99s Week 12 value.'

S'Ward has slipped into a smelly funk since Week 8. Over that forgettable four-game stretch, he\xe2\x80\x99s caught a useless nine passes for 53 yards with one touchdown, and one concussion. Evident in the veteran\xe2\x80\x99s sharp decline in targets, Mike Wallace has become the apple of Ben Roethlisberger\xe2\x80\x99s eye. Expect that trend to continue. The Bills are undoubtedly one of the league\xe2\x80\x99s softest defenses, particularly up the middle. Due to their interior struggles, Bruce Arians will likely run Rashard Mendenhall ragged. When facing the Bills, other teams have employed a similar strategy with considerable success. Because of this conservative approach, only three wideouts have reached 80-yards in a game against the Bills this year. Obviously, Big Ben will take a few shots downfield. However, Wallace, not Ward, will be his weapon of choice. It appears the cagey warhorse, who ranks alongside David Gettis and Randy Moss in points per game among WRs (No. 52), is slowly inching his way toward the glue factory. At this point, he\xe2\x80\x99s almost completely untrustworthy, even in PPR formats. Other WR alternatives: Mario Manningham (vs. Jax), Sidney Rice (at Was), Danny Woodhead (at Det), Nate Burleson (vs. NE), James Jones (at Atl), Ben Obomanu (vs. KC), Derek Hagan (vs. Jax)'

S'Though he has fewer follicles, bucks and blond bombshells at his side, Kitna is nearly identical to Tony Romoin every way  at least, statistically speaking. Do a side-by-side comparison of the QBs numbers this season and there little difference. As Berry Tramel of the Oklahoman suggested earlier this week, it time to give the 38-year-old his due. Leading a much-improved Cowboys team, Kitna has averaged 239.2 passing yards per game and posted a 10:4 TD:INT split since Week 10. More surprisingly, the spry passer has chipped in 24 rushing yards per contest. His subsequent 22.8 points per week ranks No. 5 at his position. Another top-tiered effort should be expected in Week 15. In nearly every phase of the game, Washington has rarely challenged the opposition, especially vertically. Signal callers have compiled 270.5 yards and 1.5 touchdowns per game against the Skins, equal to the fifth-most fantasy points. Minus LaRon Landry and with Carlos Rogers nursing a tender hamstring, Washington is in a disadvantageous position against an explosive offense. Romo threw for 284 yards and a TD Week 1 in the nation capital. Expect Kitna to be even better in the encore. Ride em Cowboy.'

S'The Football Frankenstein freakish mixture of size, speed and strength is as unique as a Slash guitar riff. His burst around the edge and between the tackles brawn are remarkable for a player that stands at 6-foot-5, 260-pounds. Nagging injuries have limited Jacobs the last two years, causing Ahmad Bradshaw to seize carries. Now healthy, he once again imposing his will on would-be tacklers, running with considerable power and purpose. Since reacquiring the starting job in Week 10, he pulverized defenders, averaging 102 yards per game and an insane 8.5 yards per carry. Over that span, he also reached the pylons three times. The fresh rusher admitted Monday he never felt this good at this point in the season. Earlier this season, the Giants had evolved into a pass-centric team. But injuries and Eli Manning turnover woes have forced Tom Coughlin to get back to what the G-Men do best, pound the rock. Expect that formula to continue against Michael Vick Eagles. With  and Mario Manningham  unlikely to play this week, Jacobs and Bradshaw will be featured prominently in a critical NFC East battle. Though Philly has only allowed 3.7 yards per carry to rushers over the past five weeks, it has struggled mightily in red zone defense. Since Week 9, the Eagles have given up seven touchdowns to RBs. Look for the Giants to dominate the line of scrimmage with defensive leader Stewart Bradley out for the rest of the season. Fantasy reanimated monster will continue to be a playoff beast.'

S'Stewie Beef is making a strong case to open 2011 as the starter in Charlotte. Since returning to full strength three weeks ago, the between-the-tackles bowling ball has rolled his way to a 107.7 rushing yards per game average, including an impressive 133 yards against one of the league stingiest run defenses, Atlanta. More incredibly, he racked 6.3 yards per carry over that stretch. The Oregon product credits the offensive line for the ground game stunning turnaround. Discombobulated earlier this year, the gelled unit has dominated the line of scrimmage, regularly opening up massive lanes for Stewart and Mike Goodson to burst through. This week, creating walrus-wide holes will hardly be a chore. Humiliated often this season, Arizona has failed miserably in gap execution. Since Week 10, the Cards have conceded a mind-blowing 4.7 yards per carry, 174.2 total yards per game and eight TDs to rushers, equal to the third-most fantasy points. Due to Jimmy Clausen ongoing incompetence and Zona respectable pass defense, Stewart and Goodson will be featured prominently. For the former, eclipsing the century mark for the second straight week seems inevitable. Light the powder keg.'

S'Hightower is the Kristen Bell of running backs. Similar to the smokin, yet constantly dissed on hot lists, actress, he is terribly underrated. Even when gifted a favorable matchup, most owners house indifferent feelings for the rusher. This unworthy treatment explains why he currently rostered in only 50 percent of Y! leagues. However, those whove bought into Hightower just might laugh their way all the way to the bank. Last week, he gashed the Broncos for a season-high 148 yards and two touchdowns. Most impressive to Ken Whisenhunt, 97 of those yards came after the back was temporarily benched for losing a fumble early in the fourth quarter. Assuming Hightower can firmly grip the rock, another fantasy points bonanza could be in store in Carolina. No defense has yielded more points to plowshares since Week 10. Over that span, the Panthers have allowed 4.6 yards per carry, 174.8 total yards per game and 12 touchdowns. Because of inexperience, naysayers will argue Hightower will constantly face stacked boxes. Though true, it will be no different than any other week. And dont worry about Beanie Wells The combustible back, who was limited last week by a gastrointestinal issue (Feminine cramps?), continues to fail in the little things department. Another stellar performance and Hightower will don a cape. Get with the hero.'

S'Crumpets, tea and plenty of fantasy points are on the menu for Britt this week versus Houston. Fully recovered from a hamstring injury which cost him four games, the early season standout was immediately reinserted into the starting lineup a week ago, catching four passes for 39 yards (eight targets). After shaking off the rust, the ultra-talented wideout should regain his pre-injury form. Recall from Weeks 3-7 he scored in every game and averaged a very healthy 78.6 yards per contest. As noted endlessly this season, the Texans secondary is a defensive sieve. Only fellow Lone Star representative, Dallas, has given up more fantasy points to receivers. Corner Glover Quin though light years better than teammate Kareem Jackson will provide little resistance to the athletic pass catcher. Jeff Fisher has hinted Randy Moss could. But let be frank, the veteran epitaph was written weeks ago. The younger, more explosive receiver will be Kerry Collins favorite target. Titanic numbers are in the offing. Ello guvnor!'

S'This time two years ago, Williams was crushing fruitcakes at an astonishing pace. Now leaner and meaner, Matt Millen biggest bust&rd has shed the degrading label. When healthy, Left Coast Mike has performed admirably totaling nearly 60 yards per game, including three 100-yard efforts. Hampered by a foot injury over the past couple weeks, Williams is slated to return to practice Wednesday. Barring a setback, he should draw the start against a very vulnerable Atlanta secondary. On the year, the Falcons have surrendered the fifth-most fantasy points to wide receivers. With a six-inch height advantage over Dunta Robinson Williams will undoubtedly be the apple of Matt Hasselbeck eye 12-15 targets are not out of the question. Because of Seattle problems running the ball and Atlanta ability to defend it, the Hawks must look skyward if they want to move the chains. The end zone has been elusive for the 26-year-old, but this week, a pay-dirt splash or two is very possible. Step up to the Mike.'

S"Deep down weve harbored a many man-crush for Jennings. The product of Samkon Gado-U (Liberty) is a fabulous mixture of power, speed and versatility. If not buried behind Maurice Jones-Drew the second-year back would be a fantasy star. On just five carries last week against Oakland he rushed for 109 yards and a touchdown, a performance which gave locals Fred Taylor flashbacks. Though he's accumulated double-digit touches only twice this season, his role is set to expand this week against Indy&#8217;s pliable front. This season, the Colts have given up 4.8 yards per carry, 164.2 total yards per game and 14 touchdowns to RBs equal to the sixth-most fantasy points. Considering the Jags&#8217; shortcomings in pass defense, Jack Del Rio will likely follow a run-early, run-often philosophy in an attempt to keep the ball out of Peyton Manning hands. If the strategy proves successful, MoJo and Jennings could carry the rock a combined 40 times. Owners in deeper leagues willing to gamble on a high-risk, high-reward flex play, Jennings is worth the dice roll."

S"Storm the White Cassel and you're sure to get burned, or feel repulsed. Speaking from experience, air-quality post-slider consumption can often reach nose-tucking levels. But there's been nothing repugnant about Cassel's recent string of performances. He\xe2\x80\x99s absorbed the nuances of Charlie Weis\xe2\x80\x99 system beautifully, sharpening his technique and timing. With one of the league\xe2\x80\x99s best rushing attacks, an immovable offensive line and TD-machine Dwayne Bowe to throw to, the surging passer has developed into an elite fantasy quarterback. Blasphemy you say? Just look at his recent production. Over his past seven starts, the red-hot QB has compiled an obscene 18:1 td:int split. He\xe2\x80\x99s also averaged a respectable 236.7 yards per game. His subsequent 24.5 points per game ranks only behind Michael Vick during that stretch. As Todd Haley said earlier this week, he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cset the bar higher and higher\xe2\x80\x9d as the season has progressed. Despite his remarkable success, the ignorant refuse to trust him, evident in his low weekly start percentage. Naysayers take notice. If you own Cassel, you're playing him this week. In a game which has \xe2\x80\x9cshootout\xe2\x80\x9d written all over it, he should turn a top-10 profit. Over the past five weeks, the Broncos have allowed nearly 29 points per week to signal callers (301.5 ypg, 12:1 td:int), the most in the league. Yes, Cassel, who benefited from a 35-point first-half deficit Week 10 in Denver, likely won\xe2\x80\x99t come close to 400 yards, but another TD hat-trick is certainly possible. Hail to the Chief!"

S"Jackson's impact on fantasy is similar to Leslie Neilsen's on the comedy arts \xe2\x80\x93 grossly underapprecaiated. He would never be included in a discussion about the game\xe2\x80\x99s best multi-purpose backs. Most agree he\xe2\x80\x99s not the same caliber as an Arian Foster, Chris Johnson, Adrian Peterson or Peyton Hillis.  But he\xe2\x80\x99s closer than you may think. Since C.J. Spiller pulled up lame in Week 10, the overlooked rusher has gone bananas. Over the three-game stretch, he's averaged 154 total yards per game and accumulated five touchdowns, good for an RB-best 25.4 points per contest. Based on his 163-yard thrashing of the league's stingiest defense, Pittsburgh, last week he's become matchup proof. Minnesota is another tall task, but Jackson is prepared to grab Ragnar by the locks. The Vikings have surrendered just 3.5 yards per carry this season, but have struggled to contain rushers outside the tackle box. RBs have caught 5.6 receptions per game against them, the eighth-most in tackle football. Similar to last week, Jackson may do most of his damage as a dump-off receiver. Respect the man. Appreciate the results. But don't blame the man upstairs if the numbers don't work out.   "

S"Stewie Beef hasn't packed the protein or the points for fantasy owners this season. Physical setbacks and Carolina's humiliating offense has stymied the rusher's statistical output. However, last week, after returning from a two-game hiatus, Stewart showcased the power and burst that had owners salivating preseason, finishing with a season-best 98 yards on 12 carries. His follow-up effort will likely be even better. The absence of defensive end Red Bryant has turned Seattle into a feeble defense. Since Week 8, only NFC West counterpart Arizona has been steamrolled more. Over that span, the 'Hawks have surrendered an absurd 5.0 yards per carry, 219 total yards per game and seven touchdowns. The Panthers' resurgent offensive line should have little difficulty creating lanes for Stewie to plow through. Yes, Mike Goodson will still be heavily involved, but because DeAngelo Williams' future is cloudy in Carolina, the front office wants to see what the current tandem is made of. In-game circumstances will determine his workload, but given Seattle's defensive inadequacies, the Panthers, similar last week against a more competitive Cleveland team, should keep the outcome close enough to net Stewart at least 15 touches. Believe."

S'News the PT Cruiser could finally pull out of the garage complicates matters for the Saints. But because the incumbent has missed eight weeks with an unsubstantiated torn ankle tendon, he will likely be eased back into action. Even with PT potentially on the field, Ivory should maintain a substantial role. His tough interior running \xe2\x80\x93 he\'s averaged a stout 4.8 yards per carry \xe2\x80\x93 is best-suited for short-yardage work, especially at the goal-line. In other words, he could become the new Mike Bell. Cincinnati\'s defensive line, one of the most unyielding units in the league a year ago, has greatly underachieved. This season, rushers have tallied 4.5 yards per carry, 134.6 total yards per game and 10 touchdowns against it. Due to the crowded backfield, touches will be a premium for Ivory. However, because the Saints, as Drew Brees remarked earlier this week, are "back to their brand of football," the rookie could receive numerous goal-line touches. He\'s risky even as a flex option in 12-team leagues, but the profit potential is hard to ignore. Based on the matchup, someone in the Saints backfield is bound to reward the dice-rollers. '

S"Due to the spread-the-wealth nature of Mike Martz' offense and the constant heat on Jay Cutler, Fort Knox hasn't exactly been the golden commodity many forecasted preseason. However, with at least five receptions in four of his past six contests, he's developed into a reliable PPR producer. Another appreciable line should be expected in Week 13. Lately, the Bears have emphasized the run early in games with considerable success. Given the vulnerability of the Lions on the ground, Knox should attract several one-on-one opportunities. Detroit, shredded via land and air by the Patriots on Turkey Day, will again be picked apart. Corners Chris Houston and Alphonso Smith have performed marginally. On the year, the pair has yielded 14 70-yard efforts and 14 touchdowns to wide receivers equal to the 11th-most fantasy points allowed. Touchdowns have been elusive for Knox, but based on the favorable matchup, he's must start material even in shallow formats.  "

S"Seeing his first action since undergoing minor knee surgery on October 26, Alexander picked up where he left off. Playing just 20 snaps against the Broncos, he hauled in four catches for 95 yards. The undrafted product from Mizzou is a Vincent Jackson-type talent. Though he's Greg Oden-durable, the rookie has terrific size (6-foot-5), explosiveness and athleticism. For the ghastly Cardinals, he's a major headache. Wideouts have performed 19.8-percent above the league average against the Desert Birds. Top targets especially have thrived, averaging 90.9 yards per game. With smallish corner Michael Adams (5-foot-8) likely to draw the start over injured Greg Toler, the Rams coaching staff will draw up isolation packages featuring Alexander to take advantage of the size disparity. Sam Bradford, whose been on a monster tear over the past four weeks (245.8 ypg, 8:1 td:int), should have no problem delivering crisp passes downfield. Assuming he can make it through the game in one piece, the unheralded target could be this week's Ben Obomanu. Take a chance deep leaguers. "

S'It\'s been an exasperating year for the buried rusher. "The odd man out" in Dallas\' backfield rotation, he\'s unfairly been relegated to spot duty and special teams work. However, with Marion Barber on the shelf nursing a calf injury, the shackled back is finally free. Expect Choice to take out his frustration on the competition. Discussed in this space endlessly, the undersized Colts are a giving defense. Opposing runners have averaged 4.9 yards per carry, 156.2 total yards per game and scored 12 touchdowns against them equal to the eighth-most fantasy points allowed. Based on this weakness, Jason Garrett will surely draw up a ground-heavy game-plan. Undoubtedly, Felix Jones will be the primary carrier, but Choice will be deployed in most, if not all, short-yardage and goal-line situations. On 10-15 touches, he could be quite flex useful in deeper leagues. A playoff hero in 2008, the underused backup will again produce in the clutch.'

S"Mr. Gisele Bundchen's gradual Ken doll transformation is alarming. So is his Week 13 matchup. Since Darrelle Revis' return to full strength five weeks ago, the Jets have had every QB's number. Over that stretch no signal caller has surpassed 260 yards and only Matthew Stafford has accounted for multiple touchdowns. Speculation has run wild this week exactly how Rex Ryan plans to align his defensive backfield. On Tuesday, the demonstrative coach offered clues about assignments, hinting Revis could shadow Wes Welker. However, given New England\xe2\x80\x99s bevy of weapons and spread-it-out configuration, a zone scheme seems more likely.  No matter how the tandem is deployed, numerous incompletions should be expected. As Mike Salfino pointed out earlier this week, quarterbacks have completed a mere 41-percent of passes directed at Revis and Antonio Cromartie, well below the 61-percent league-wide average. Brady tallied 15 fantasy points when the AFC goliaths clashed in Week 2. Expect the encore to be less fruitful. Ugg(s) indeed. Possible QB alternatives: Matt Cassel (vs. Den), Jay Cutler (at Det), Sam Bradford (at Ari), Ryan Fitzpatrick (at Min)"

S'Against the surging Chargers, it won\'t be "Christmas in Hollis" for Run DMC. Over the past two weeks, the Raider\'s McFake alter-ego has resurfaced. He\'s totaled just 47.5 yards per game without a touchdown while netting a horrifying 0.8 yards per carry. Insiders have heard behind closed doors the coaching staff is concerned he\'s reverted to his former pussyfooting ways. Meanwhile, tackle Langston Walker simply believes McFadden\'s sudden downturn can be attributed to defenses "loading up against the run." No matter the reason, the former top pick is avoidable in Week 13. The Bolts, arguably the most well-rounded defense in the league, have allowed just three rushers to reach the 65-yard mark since Week 2, giving up only 3.8 yards per carry. Due to the umbrella nature of Ron Rivera\'s defense, soft spots underneath can be exploited. As Knowshon Moreno showed earlier this year and Donald Brown last week, backs that battle San Diego typically contribute soundly in PPR formats. Still, in standard leagues, expect another major letdown. '

S"Since we bleed Orange and Blue, our unabashed love for Rashard is well-documented. We can't wait to gift him an Illinois Snuggie this holiday season. However, this week, the bro-mance is on hold. Gashed by the run earlier this year, Baltimore has stiffened in the trenches. Since Week 5 only two backs have punctured the invisible pool against them. Also, during that span, only Mike Goodson has eclipsed 70-yards on the ground. Mendenhall has been a beast of burden over the past two weeks accounting for a Franco Harris-era 59 carries. Because of Ben Roethlisberger's visible gimpiness, he'll will again be worked like a mule. However, don't expect him to duplicate his Week 4 performance (88-2) against the division rival. Unless Big Ben can keep Ray Lewis and company honest downfield, yards will be hard to come by between the tackles. In a game which could be a war of attrition, Mendy may send playoff-seeking owners packing. Possible RB alternatives: Mike Tolbert (vs. Oak), Fred Jackson (at Min), Thomas Jones (vs. Den), Felix Jones (at Ind), Jonathan Stewart (at Sea), Mike Goodson (at Sea)"

S"News of Shaun Hill's season-ending finger injury is a crushing blow for Megatron, who will now run routes for Drew Stanton. Over 104 career pass attempts, the former Spartan QB has tallied an unsavory 52.9 completion percentage. Detroit's offensive line has protected the pocket well this season, yielding just 20 sacks. But the Bears, fresh off an enormous win against Michael Vick and the Eagles, should be able to apply pressure early and often, limiting Stanton's chances of connecting downfield with Johnson. Yes, the vengeful wideout is using Week 1's controversial no-catch as motivation this week. But since Charles Tillman and friends have surrendered just six touchdowns and five 75-yard WR performances this year, Johnson may not taste revenge. Remember, he finished with just four catches for 45 yards (0 tds) against Chicago in Week 1. Megatron has failed to total 10 fantasy points in a week just three times. This week could likely be his fourth. "

S"Twinkle, twinkle rookie star. Why the hell have you tumbled so far? Bryant, practically unstoppable during the middle portion of the season, has landed on hard times over the past two weeks. Victimized by his own success, defensive coordinators have made Bryant the focal point of their schemes, increasing double-teams on the young wideout. Since Week 12, he's caught a lowly three passes for eight yards. It's understandable why he went all T.O. on the sidelines Thanksgiving Day. Just like any unrefined, extremely talented player, he'll learn to adjust. However, don't expect an overnight transformation. The Colts are one of the league's stingiest pass defenses. On the year, the Cover 2 scheme has surrendered eight receiver touchdowns and eight 70-yard efforts equal to the eighth-fewest fantasy points allowed. Based on Mike Tolbert's success in the trenches last week, Jason Garrett may follow a similar ground-and-pound approach. Felix Jones and elevated third-stringer Tashard Choice will be worked extensively. Scoring opportunities could be few and far between for Bryant. If you have an adequate crutch at WR, lean on him. Possible WR Alternatives: Braylon Edwards (at NE), Mario Manningham (vs. Was), Mike Williams, TB (vs. Atl), Danario Alexander (at Ari), Johnny Knox (at Det), Steve Johnson (at Min)"

S"Mine with this prospector and you're sure to unearth a large chunck of fantasy pyrite. Last week, VD\xe2\x80\x99s impassioned, tear-jerking speech given before San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s thrashing of Arizona was worthy of a motivational poster. Matt Foley would've been proud. Unfortunately, it propelled his team, not his fantasy numbers, to greatness. Davis, hampered by an ankle injury over the past two weeks, has practically vanished, catching only three passes for 35 yards. Another mellow effort appears likely. Though the Niners could be playing from behind, Davis should only be trusted in deeper formats. The Packers have conceded a bland 4.8 receptions and 53.4 yards per game to oversized targets this season. They've also allowed only three touchdowns. This week's projected benign line will be the latest in what's been a very disappointing second half for VD. Pan for gold elsewhere. Possible TE alternatives: Visanthe Shiancoe (vs. Buf), Kevin Boss (vs. Was), Joel Dreessen (at Phi), Todd Heap (vs. Pit), Greg Olsen (at Det)"

Based on the personnel moves Raheem Morris\xe2\x80\x99s club made this past offseason, the unit won\xe2\x80\x99t magically reverse course overnight. Jake Delhomme, who appears to have turned back the clock, enhances the competency of the Browns\xe2\x80\x99 passing attack. His ability to keep the Bucs defense honest will create wide running lanes for Harrison. Also, keep in mind the Browns have an exceptional offensive line.

S'Owners who snagged the overlooked rusher will be loving life in The Lou. On Monday, Ken Whisenhunt noted styrofoam rusher Beanie Wells is dealing with a mysterious knee injury and is \xe2\x80\x9cnot 100 percent.\xe2\x80\x9d As a result of the former Buckeye\xe2\x80\x99s setback and Hightower\xe2\x80\x99s exceptional play this preseason, the versatile veteran gets the start against the Rams. Over the past several seasons, St. Louis has been incredibly generous to opposing rushers, multi-dimensional backs in particular. Last season, the Rams allowed 157 total yards per game to RBs. Running with increased assertiveness, Hightower will likely be the focal point of Russ Grimm\xe2\x80\x99s gameplan even running behind a transparent offensive line. Because of Derek Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s general inconsistency (career 52.9 completion percentage), look for Hightower to also be featured heavily in the passing game. Recall last year in two contests against the familiar opponent, the Richmond product averaged a stout 4.9 yards per carry and 80 total yards per game. Wells should be available, but anticipate Hightower to shoulder roughly 60 percent of the workload. Count on him as a flex or RB2 option in deeper leagues.'

The undrafted wideout\xe2\x80\x99s towering frame should wreak havoc against an exploitable Chiefs defense. Adding rookie headhunter Eric Berry definitely bolsters KC\xe2\x80\x99s secondary, but undersized corner Brandon Flowers (5-foot-9) is no match for the 6-foot-5 Floyd. Expect Philip Rivers to take advantage of the size disparity often. Remember in a more limited role last year, the lanky receiver hauled in five passes for 94 yards and a score in two games against the Chiefs. Jackson racked seven receptions for 169 yards and a touch. Trust him as a high-tiered WR2 even in shallow formats. Shine on you crazy diamond.'

When on the field \xe2\x80\x93 he missed six games in \xe2\x80\x9909 ndash; Mathis was picked on with considerable success. According to Football Outsiders, top targets performed 20.1 percent above the league average against the not-so-shutdown corner. Without adequate help over the top, Josh McDaniels will not be afraid to call shots Mathis\xe2\x80\x99 way. Gaffney outdistanced Eddie Royal for No. 1 duties this preseason and is poised to build on last year\xe2\x80\x99s career-highs in receptions and yards.

S'Not to be confused with the Seattle receiver with the same name, Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s Williams is an up-and-coming rookie destined to make a strong opening statement. Cleveland showed sporadic improvement on pass defense a year ago, but remains susceptible entering the season. The youngster\xe2\x80\x99s fabulous mixture of size, speed and athleticism poses a problem for diminutive corners Eric Wright and Sheldon Brown, a duo burned often last year. Primary targets performed 18.3 percent above the league average against the Browns in \xe2\x80\x9909. With Josh Freeman slated to start, Williams figures to attract a healthy number of targets. A top-flight WR3 total in 12-team and deeper leagues is very likely. Currently started in just five percent of Y! leagues, he is a medium-risk, high-reward option in Week 1.'

S"Staring at Camarillo\xe2\x80\x99s mugshot, it's hard not tabbing him \xe2\x80\x9cThe Situation.\xe2\x80\x9d The same is true on the field. Acquired from Miami two weeks ago, the fourth-year pass catcher was thrust into a very favorable fantasy environment. With Sidney Rice down for at least half the regular season and Percy Harvin one unpredictable migraine away from the sidelines, Camarillo figures to play a prominent role this season. After Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s opener he could be the hottest waiver add in Fantasyland. In what will surely be a scoring bonanza on the bayou, the slot machine will do his best Wes Welker impersonation. His slippery ability to find soft spots in zone coverage, fearlessness in traffic and precise route-running may cause headaches for a Saints defense possibly minus Jonathan Vilma. The blanketing attention Harvin will receive only enhances Camarillo\xe2\x80\x99s chances for a sizable payoff. Deep leaguers in PPR-heavy formats looking to roll the dice should plug-n-play the 98-percent available wideout."

S'And you should run, run so far away. Against the Revis-italized Jets secondary, the Flacco Seagulls won\xe2\x80\x99t deliver a fantasy hit. This battle has all the trappings of a grind-it-out slug-fest. Despite adding T.J. Houshmandzadeh to an already stout receiving corps, the third-year signal caller has a daunting task against a Jets defense that surrendered a mere 167.7 passing yards per game and eight touchdowns to passers a season ago, far and away the lowest in the league. Unless Ray Rice can break a few big gainers in the passing game, bench-worthy totals are inevitable for the hyped QB. Rex Ryan will successfully throw the kitchen sink at Flacco early and often, rattling the young passer\xe2\x80\x99s confidence. Matthew Stafford (at Chi), Alex Smith (at Sea) and, shockingly, Sam Bradford (vs. Ari) will likely outperform the popular mid-round loverboy this week.'

S'The last time the Little Napoleon invaded New York, the roaring Giants crowd was silenced. His spectacular 108-yard, four-TD effort during the most crucial point of the fantasy season in 2008 devastated any unfortunate soul who played against him. Roto Arcade\xe2\x80\x99s own Andy Behrens still weeps uncontrollably just thinking about it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t expect a repeat performance in the rematch. Battered by injuries a year ago, the Giants defensive line underperformed conceding 1.3 touchdowns per game to rushers. Now rejuvenated, they should be stiffer versus the run, especially against a largely one-dimensional Carolina offense. Hole-plugger Jonathan Goff will be vital to New York\xe2\x80\x99s success in containing D-Will and Jonathan Stewart. Assuming he can sniff out the gaps, the Panthers ground game will be declawed. New year. New stadium. New defense. The G-Men get their revenge.'

S'Unyielding best describes the Packers\xe2\x80\x99 efforts in the trenches a season ago. Swallowing running backs whole, the 3-4-based unit allowed just 3.5 yards per carry and four 100 total yard performances to fantasy cornerstones. Because of Kevin Kolb\xe2\x80\x99s preseason struggles \xe2\x80\x93 he failed to find the end-zone and completely just 52.8 percent of his passes \xe2\x80\x93 Marty Morninweg may stray away from conventionality by attempting to push the pigskin on the ground. The second-year rusher is a tremendously gifted back with superb all-around skills, but unless Kolb emerges from the cocoon, he will be suffocated. This week, the Pitt product only has value in deeper PPR leagues. Think like a Hatfield. Against the Packers, you want nothing to do with this McCoy.'

S'For much of 2010, New York\xe2\x80\x99s version of the Greene Monster will be unstoppable. His bruising between-the-tackles nature in a largely conservative system will generate appreciable numbers. However, this week expect the beast to be caged. The interior is clearly the Ravens\xe2\x80\x99 defensive strength. Haloti Ngata and Kelly Gregg are certified man-eaters. Ray Lewis, Jameel McCLain and Terrell Suggs also have a taste for RB flesh. Though the aging Ravens may not be as dominate as they were just a couple seasons ago \xe2\x80\x93 Cedric Benson snapped Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s consecutive streak without allowing a 100-yard rusher in Week 5 last year \xe2\x80\x93 this is still an outstanding, inflexible unit which should win most wars in the trenches. Greene\xe2\x80\x99s straight-line style won\xe2\x80\x99t be intimidating. Sage owners with suitable backups should turn to the bench. Tim Hightower (at StL), Jerome Harrison (at TB), Carnell Williams (vs. Cle) and Arian Foster (vs. Ind) are finer options.'

S'Even at his advanced age Ward is still one of the toughest and slipperiest underneath targets in the league. The man has made a living routinely exploiting soft spots in zone coverage. However, with Dennis Dixon behind center, the 12-year veteran is a precarious option in Week 1. Yes, the Falcons were rather generous to fantasy receivers a season ago ranking 31st in the league against No. 1 wideouts (74.0 ypg), but Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s wretched performance in the preseason doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bode well for Ward. Look for the Falcons to throw a variety of coverages at Dixon to cause chaos and stymie his scrambling ability. The decorated wideout could notch profitable totals in PPR formats working as a short-field greaseman, but expect mediocre results in standard leagues.'

S'The PPR thoroughbred\'s quick recovery from a catastrophic knee injury is nothing short of miraculous. Seriously, he must be part-cyborg. However, as the receiver admitted last week, he\xe2\x80\x99s still "a long ways off" from operating at full strength. Welker is confident planting and cutting, but the explosiveness hasn\xe2\x80\x99t returned. Over the first few weeks of the regular season, he will have to be clever and crafty to gain separation from defenders. Because of his extraordinary route-running talents, he will be able to generate some space but his yards after contact will likely suffer. Without a dependable running game, car stuntman Tom Brady may easily chuck 40-plus balls versus Cincy. But keep in mind WR2s performed 22.3 percent below the league average against the Bengals last season. They\xe2\x80\x99re a formidable defensive bunch. Play it safe except in deep PPR formats. Under-drafted targets Mohamed Massaquoi (at TB), Devin Hester (vs. Det), Mike Williams (vs. SF) and Jabar Gaffney (at Jac) are wiser choices.'

Since his forgettable four-pick performance at Cincinnati Week 2, Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSituation\xe2\x80\x9d has performed brilliantly tossing nine touchdown passes to just one interception. Though he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made the quantum leap in production most pundits forecasted preseason \xe2\x80\x93 Cam Cameron has slowly unlaced the kid gloves \xe2\x80\x93 noticeable developmental strides have occurred. This week another evolutionary step will be made. \xe2\x80\x9cRocky\xe2\x80\x9d best describes how Miami\xe2\x80\x99s secondary has played. Second-year standout Vontae Davis has stepped up his game, but fellow corner Jason Allen hasn\xe2\x80\x99t, evident in last week\xe2\x80\x99s benching in Cincy. On the season, the \xe2\x80\x98Fins have yielded 220.5 yards per game and 10 touchdowns to passers in seven games. Due to Miami\xe2\x80\x99s stinginess in the trenches (3.9 ypc, 115 total yards per game to RBs), Cameron will likely install a pass-heavy game-plan to attack his opponent's weakness. Flacco and Anquan Boldin will be an unstoppable duo. Admire the abs."

S'Owners who exercised patience with Jackson after breaking the bank to acquire his services earlier this season have earned a just reward. Slowly marginally skilled rusher has developed into a reliable flex source, particularly in PPR leagues. Over the past three weeks, he\xe2\x80\x99s averaged an impressive 5.4 yards per touch and 86 total yards per game. As fellow Packer James Jones remarked last week, the rusher has \xe2\x80\x9ccome into a little zone.\xe2\x80\x9d In Dallas, J.R. isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only individual who\xe2\x80\x99s been shot by a mysterious killer. Several key players on defense have experienced an untimely demise. On the year, the \xe2\x80\x98Boys have conceded 4.6 yards per carry, 129.7 total yards per game and five touchdowns to rushers. More alarming, only 29.7 percent of ground plays versus Dallas have gone for zero or negative yards, the lowest amount in the NFC. The ground game will be emphasized. Jackson will also be a vital dump-off outlet for Aaron Rodgers in the short-field if DeMarcus Ware and cohorts remain overaggressive. Smother him in Velveeta.'

S'Shutdown Corner calls Tolbert the Kool-Aid Man. Because of his short, portly frame and interchangeable part, Mr. Potatohead is equally appropriate. San Diego\xe2\x80\x99s preeminent goal-line gremlin has been a painful thorn in the side of Ryan Mathews owners, crossing the chalk in six of eight games. After two unsubstantial workloads in Weeks 6 and 7, Norv Turner deployed the stocky rusher 15 times last week against Tennessee. After averaging nearly 6.0 yards per touch, a similar role could be carved out for the former Chanticleer in Week 9. Turner appears committed to establishing a formidable running game. Brian Cushing\xe2\x80\x99s switch to inside linebacker didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay instant dividends defending the interior last week in Indy. Third-stringer Mike Hart averaged a ridiculous 7.0 yards per carry. Throw in the Texans\xe2\x80\x99 ongoing shortcomings against the pass, Tolbert could net a \xe2\x80\x9cpunch-in\xe2\x80\x9d opportunity or three. Slide him in as a RB2 or Flex option in deeper leagues.'

S'It\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely criminal obtuse owners continue to underappreciate Williams. Started in just under 50-percent of Yahoo! leagues, the preseason All-Mancrush selection deserves strong WR2 consideration every single week, regardless of matchup. Averaging 10.1 points per game in standard formats, he\xe2\x80\x99s outperformed the likes of Greg Jennings, Larry Fitzgerald and Brandon Marshall. Full disclosure, every time he hauls in a long reception, "Sweet Child O\' Mine" cues in our head. This week, another rockstar effort is in the offing. Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s downfield blanket, Dunta Robinson, still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been cleared by team doctors after suffering a nasty concussion in Week 6. Even if he plays, Williams should have the upper-hand. In seven games, opposing WR1s have compiled 79.6 yards per game against the Falcons. Considering Atlanta has also yielded 7.8 yards per pass attempt, Josh Freeman will undoubtedly take a number of deep shots with the rookie. Expect multiple explosive connections. Owners in unchallenging formats need to show him the respect he deserves.'

The Spidey-handed receiver, who\xe2\x80\x99s reeled in an impressive 81-percent of passes targeted for him, has become arguably the most dependable third-down receiver in the league. His adroitness underneath and increasing reliance inside the red zone could lead strong WR2 totals this week against the Ravens. Baltimore has been incredibly generous to receivers this season. Wideouts have performed 51.8 percent above the league average against it. Slot machines in particular have achieved a fair amount of success. Wes Welker, Roscoe Parrish and Jordan Shipley each posted admirable numbers for the PPR masses. Because of Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s improved execution in the trenches and Miami\xe2\x80\x99s persistent problems penetrating the line, Chad Henne will be entrusted to move the chains, enhancing Bess\xe2\x80\x99 workload.

S'Admittedly a stab-in-the-dark play against the Texans on Monday night, Tamme proved to be a free agent ninja, slicing and dicing his way to six catches for 64 yards and a touchdown. The third-year tight end displayed the athleticism and, most importantly, route-running savvy needed to fill Dallas Clark\xe2\x80\x99s massive shoes. It\xe2\x80\x99s clear Peyton Manning\xe2\x80\x99s supreme confidence, work ethic and attention to detail has rubbed off on the inexperienced players around him. In Tamme\xe2\x80\x99s encore, another marquee performance should be expected. Philadelphia is allergic to mid-field coverage. Over the past couple seasons, the Eagles have shown plenty of brotherly love to enlarged targets. This year, Brandon Pettigrew, Chris Cooley, Vernon Davis and Tony Gonzalez all posted at least nine fantasy points against them. A similar tally for Tamme should be expected. As we stated Tuesday, the waiver leviathan is now must-start material. Add. Start. Party without pants.'

S'A.J. Smith has become quite the collector of unpronounceable receiving talent from the WAC. The undrafted rookie, who was teammates with Ryan Mathews at Fresno State, is in line for a significant workload this week in Houston. Buster Davis was placed on injured reserve Tuesday and hamstrung receivers Malcom Floyd and Legadu Naanee are unlikely to see the field. Similar in style and substance as fellow WAC daddy Naanee, Ajirotutu is a lengthy target with considerable athleticism, size (6-foot-3, 210-pounds) and big-play ability. Physically, he could pose a problem for corner Kareem Jackson who\xe2\x80\x99s been torched often this season. Secondary receivers have averaged 69.1 yards per game against the Texans corner. Considering Houston\xe2\x80\x99s overall troubles in downfield coverage \xe2\x80\x93 they\xe2\x80\x99ve surrendered 23 20-yard pass plays this year \xe2\x80\x93 and the attention drawn by Antonio Gates, Ajirotutu could emerge from the darkest recesses of the wavier wire to produce starter-worthy numbers in 12-team leagues. Keep in mind in two games this year functioning as a tertiary option, he averaged a healthy 14.8 yards per catch. Shock the world.'

S'Forget Happy Meals, disgruntled owners burned repeatedly by mediocre Schaub efforts should place a one-week ban on the quarterback. Through seven games, the rollercoaster ride has averaged just 18.2 points per week, the 18th-best mark among qualifying starters. Unhealthy targets, inconsistent pass protection and the emergence of Arian Foster have equally contributed to passer\xe2\x80\x99s decline. At the regular season\xe2\x80\x99s midway point, he\xe2\x80\x99s tallied a YPA nearly a full yard less than last year. Don\xe2\x80\x99t expect a sudden turnaround. Aside from Week 8, San Diego\xe2\x80\x99s 3-4 has performed masterfully against the pass. The Chargers have allowed a league-low 176.9 passing yards per game and a minuscule 6.3 yards per attempt. Only Vince Young has tossed multiple touchdowns against them. With Andre Johnson no where close to 100 percent and the ground game clicking, another Texas misstep is on the horizon for Schaub. Maybe he truly is possessed by the ghost of David Carr. Possible QB alternatives: Michael Vick (vs. Ind), Josh Freeman (at Atl), Joe Flacco (vs. Mia), Matt Ryan (vs. TB)'

S'The revolting smell that wafts above the skies of Oakland isn\xe2\x80\x99t related to Al Davis\xe2\x80\x99 slow decomposition or the Raiders\xe2\x80\x99 rotting teams of yesteryear. Nope, it\xe2\x80\x99s the festering disease recent opponents have acquired visiting The Coliseum. Jones\xe2\x80\x99 Chiefs could be the next to be infected. Gashed for much of the season by the run, the Raiders turned a corner last week against Seattle, holding Marshawn Lynch to a ghastly seven yards on nine carries. Tom Cable spoke highly of his team\xe2\x80\x99s performance, commending his defensive line for \xe2\x80\x9ctaking responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d Containing Jamaal Charles and Jones is a far more daunting task, especially if Nnamdi Asomugha sits, but with Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s confidence at an eight-year high, it could again overachieve. Occasional scoring lapses have occurred for Jones this year, even against charitable fronts. Clashes with Indy and Buffalo yielded lackluster results (8-19-0 (vs. Ind), 19-77-0 (vs. Buf)). The Chiefs\xe2\x80\x99 offensive line has exceeded expectations, creating massive holes. On paper, they should dominate a Raiders D that\xe2\x80\x99s allowed 4.9 yards per carry to RBs. But in this unpredictable game, simple logic is often defied.'

S'Blount has finally gone mainstream. Last week\xe2\x80\x99s 22-carry, 120-yard, 2-TD trucking of Arizona topped the RB charts. Understandably, with many still suffering from the bye week blues, the bulldozing back is a popular start choice. Unfortunately, owner exuberance will eventually give way to disappointment. Blount is a powerful between-the-tackles rusher, an unrefined Michael Turner if you will. But against The Burner\xe2\x80\x99s team he will be extinguished. North-South runners have been stuffed against Hot-lanta this season. Peyton Hillis and Cedric Benson are prime examples. On the year, the Falcons have yielded just 2.9 yards per carry to rushers who\xe2\x80\x99ve plodded up-the-gut, the third-lowest mark in the league. Overall, they\xe2\x80\x99ve limited backs to a mere three touchdowns and 4.0 yards per carry. Unless he\xe2\x80\x99s rewarded with a goal-line touch or two, the rookie is due for a letdown. Brighter days are ahead, but this week, pass on the Blount.'

S'The fact that Woodhead is currently being started in more leagues than Mike Williams (TB), Matt Forte, Blount and Dez Bryant is virtual insanity. Yes, D2 product one-half Rudy, one-half mutant beaver and his rags to riches story, presumably starring Turtle from \xe2\x80\x9cEntourage,\xe2\x80\x9d will one day grace the silver screen, but a multi-eligible commodity that has averaged 10 touches per game shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a majority start. An argument could be made in PPR leagues, but in standard formats, which make up nearly two-thirds of the Yahoo! fantasy population, he\xe2\x80\x99s a matchup-dependent option. Keep in mind he\xe2\x80\x99s barely ranked inside the top-30 among RBs over the past five weeks, the top-25 for WRs. As running backs coach Ivan Fears noted earlier this week, the underdog has filled Kevin Faulk\xe2\x80\x99s shoes nicely. His sponge-like absorption of the Patriots playbook and near flawless assignment execution has quickly elevated the Jets castoff into a prominent role. For that, he deserves credit. However, the hype machine gets unplugged this week. The Browns have been rabid versus the run this season. Rushers have performed 19.9-percent below the league average against them, splashing six just three times while averaging a bland 4.1 yards per carry. As a WR3 or flex option in deeper formats, Woodhead is employable, but there is no way he should be trusted over the names discussed above. Possible RB alternatives: Brandon Jackson (vs. Dal), Mike Tolbert (at Hou), Darren Sproles (at Hou), Michael Bush (vs. KC)'

S'Trotting out No. 85 against the Steelers is like hiring Elmer Fudd to hunt down Osama Bin Laden, a fruitless endeavor. No brand of Old Spice can mask the repugnant outputs Ochostanko has tallied against Pittsburgh in recent years. Since 2008, he\xe2\x80\x99s averaged just 45.0 yards per game and found the end-zone once in three games. To further complicate matters, it appears, based on the comments he made on the TOcho Show this week, the demonstrative wideout has unfriended Carson Palmer on Facebook. His frustration over his shrinking role has made Ocho a very unhappy camper. The Steelers aren\xe2\x80\x99t impossible to throw on. They\xe2\x80\x99ve actually conceded the third-most receptions to WRs this year. Still, No. 2 targets that have encountered the Steel Curtain have netted only 45.3 yards per game. Given his forgettable past against Pittsburgh, discordant feelings toward Palmer and overall downturn in production, Ochocinco simply can\xe2\x80\x99t be trusted this week and possibly beyond. Cancel the show.'

S'Rescuing his sinking value over the past two weeks catching 16 passes for 187 yards and two scores, Colston appears to have finally reached safe ground. However, this week he\xe2\x80\x99ll exhibit his pre-resurgence form. Once again the Panthers secondary is one of the league\xe2\x80\x99s best kept defensive secrets. Corners Chris Gamble and Richard Marshall have played admirably. Wideouts have performed 43-percent below the league average against the tandem. Historically, Colston has vanished versus Carolina. In his past five battles with the NFC South rival, he\xe2\x80\x99s totaled only 41.4 yards per game and one touchdown. Toss in Drew Brees\xe2\x80\x99 socialist nature, and an underwhelming line is certainly possible. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be suckered by this MC. Possible WR alternatives: Mike Williams, TB (at Atl), Dez Bryant (at GB), Davone Bess (at Bal), Jordy Nelson (vs. Dal), James Jones (vs. Dal), Steve Johnson (vs. Chi)'

S"The Buffalo quarterback's unexpected production isn\xe2\x80\x99t the luck of the Irish. The passing brainiac, a Harvard product, has developed into an exceptional talent. Aggressive, accurate and decisive, he has flourished in Chan Gailey\xe2\x80\x99s spread offense. Suffice it to say, getting Patrick Fitz-Ryaned has definitely taken on a more flattering meaning. Astonishingly, only Philip Rivers has outpaced him in per week average. Still, the casual fantasy player idiotically remains obtuse to Fitzpatrick\xe2\x80\x99s production, evident in his remarkably low weekly start percentage. Be sure to promote him this week. The Lions boast a rising defense, but are still vulnerable against the pass. On the season, they\xe2\x80\x99ve yielded 250.9 passing yards per game and 12 touchdowns to QBs equal to the eighth-most fantasy points allowed. Because the Bills\xe2\x80\x99 passing offense continues to improve each week, largely due to the offensive line\xe2\x80\x99s execution, Fitzpatrick could finish inside the position\xe2\x80\x99s top-five. Buffalo has become very efficient on third-downs, sustaining long, clock-eating drives. Considering the matchup, the well-rounded passer will likely direct a number of scoring possessions. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to wake up and smell the coffee."

S'Fantasy prognosticators are fickle by nature. One minute a player is labeled a pauper; the next, a prince. The rookie is a prime example. Two weeks ago, everyone was rolling the Blount. Facing an overmatched Cardinals frontline, he was ranked consistently inside the top-15. However, against a stingier Falcon defense last week, Blount created a schism within the expert community. Many believed he would keep puffin\xe2\x80\x99 along. Others believed the buzz would temporarily cease. This week, the majority is back on the bandwagon, for good reason. The strength of Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s defense clearly resides with corners Chris Gamble and Richard Marshall. In the trenches, however, is where it suffers. On the year, rushers have totaled 140.8 total yards per game and seven TDs against the Panthers. Even suspect attacks have basked in success \xe2\x80\x93 Matt Forte morphed into Walter Payton in Week 5 (22-166-2). Blount\xe2\x80\x99s humiliating straight-line style is no match. This week, the youngster rediscovers the moxie.'

S'For the entire 2010 season, DeAngelo has been trapped in football purgatory. A foot injury and epically bad offense has sapped his once burgeoning value. However, loyal supporters could recuperate a small portion of their draft day investment. Sans Matt Moore and right tackle Jeff Otah, superficial viewers would consider Williams irreparable. The fallen star, whose career has sunk faster than Cuba Gooding Jr.\xe2\x80\x99s, ranks 34th in points per week among RBs. Stacked boxes will continue to shackle the Panther. However, probably not the worst run defense in the NFC. Overall, the generous Bucs have given up 5.2 yards per carry, 175.4 total yards per game and eight touchdowns to rushers. More encouraging for Carolina, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been especially vulnerable on the peripheries, an area where D-Will excels, conceding 5.3 yards per carry off-tackle. Without Jonathan Stewart in uniform he should contribute a profitable yield. Ignore the lackluster effort against Tampa from Week 2 (64 total yards, 0 TDs). The incredibly skilled rusher can create explosive gains on his own. Sheer volume implies at least a top-20 performance. Give him one more shot. (Update: With DeAngelo ruled "out" for Week 10, we\'ll score for, gulp, Mike Goodson)'

Houston\xe2\x80\x99s maligned corner has been torched by just about every receiver he\xe2\x80\x99s encountered, including Seyi Ajirotutu a week ago. Right now, a handicapped basset hound could post top-25 numbers against him. That\xe2\x80\x99s great news for those who choose to stream Thomas. Though undersized, the second-year wideout has the extra gear needed to gain separation from defenders, which against Jackson shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be difficult to achieve. On the year, No. 2 wide receivers have averaged 75.9 yards per game against the Texans. Overall, Houston has surrendered nine 80-plus yard performances and 12 touchdowns to pass catchers equal to the second-most fantasy points allowed. If David Garrard is protected adequately, he will surely fire numerous passes downfield to Thomas and Mike Sims-Walker. Gary Kubiak\xe2\x80\x99s insistence to stick with Jackson will once again blow up in his face. Bag the Jag off waivers (80-percent available) even in 10-team leagues.'

S'Last week, the old codger verbally eviscerated \xe2\x80\x9cspit on\xe2\x80\x9d defenders off-the-field. This week, he\xe2\x80\x99ll let his game do the talking on it. Unlike another 36-year-old (Terrell Owens), Mason has meandered south this season, on pace for just 60 catches for 798 yards. Despite his advanced age and dwindling production, he is still one of the game\xe2\x80\x99s most underappreciated route runners. Quick and precise, he has the ability to carve up defenses underneath. Playing second fiddle to Anquan Boldin in a somewhat conservative offense is the primary reason for the downturn, but against soft secondaries Mason is capable of turning a sizable profit. In New England Week 6, he snatched eight passes for 100 yards and last week versus Miami he hauled in a very useable four catches for 42 yards and a touchdown. Coverage woes have plagued the Falcons the entire season. Opposite Dunta Robinson, Brent Grimes has played well sporadically. However, as a whole, wide receivers have performed 54.5 percent above the league average against the undynamic duo. Because of Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s stiffness up front, Mason could attract a larger than normal workload. Turn back the clock with the graybeard as a WR3/flex in deeper leagues.'

S'In reality, Arizona ranks 28th in the league in total defense. Most casual observers would describe the unit as overly friendly. However, to the intense fantasy player, the Cardinals are a consistent scoring machine, routinely pecking out the eyes of all who are matched against them. The Seahawks better don the Dickersons. Led by spark plug LaRod Stephens-Howling on special teams and Darnell Dockett on defense, Arizona is 2010\xe2\x80\x99s version of the New Orleans Saints. The opportunistic unit has splashed pay-dirt seven times in its past five games. Over its past three, \xe2\x80\x98Zona has also coaxed six turnovers and racked 10 sacks. Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s offense should receive a shot in the arm with the likely return of Matt Hasselbeck and left tackle Russell Okung. Still, due to poor execution up front, this is a disheveled team offensively. Because the \xe2\x80\x98Hawks will struggle exploiting the Cardinals\xe2\x80\x99 primary defensive weakness, stopping the run, they will lose the battle at the line of scrimmage. If forced to the air, Arizona feasts. Seattle QBs have been sacked 22 times this season. Available in over 65-percent of Yahoo! leagues, fantasy\xe2\x80\x99s highest scoring defense (on a per week scale) deserves more respect.'

S'Because Matthew Stafford could separate his shoulder diving into a pool brimming with fluffy cotton balls, Hill is once again back at the helm for the competitive Lions. In his previous stint as the starter, the journeyman performed quite well. Over five starts he recored a top-20 QB line, averaging 244.2 yards per game with a 9:6 TD:INT split. Similar to last year, the Bills are a deceptively good pass defense. Five quarterbacks have thrown for under 200-yards against them. However, the 16:1 TD:INT allowed suggests otherwise. Not to mention most teams have trampled Buffalo in the trenches, skewing its perceived effectiveness defending the pass. Since the Lions don\xe2\x80\x99t have much of a running game, Jim Schwartz will likely devise an air-centric game plan. As a result, Hill-to-Johnson will undoubtedly haunt a Bills secondary possibly minus Terrence McGee. Aaron Rodgers owners looking for a quality bye-week filler should throw a steak to the Lion. If Hill, who is recovering form a broken arm, returns to full practice this week, a top-10 effort in the Wing City is certainly attainable. (Note: We will score Drew Stanton if Hill is unavailable).'

S'Goldilocks won\xe2\x80\x99t devour bowls of porridge this week in Pittsburgh. Brady supporters have clung to the side of the Stetson-smelling quarterback through thick and thin. Occasionally, he\xe2\x80\x99s rewarded their dedication with a top-10 performance or two, but, for the most part, investors have been forced to absorb mundane efforts. Since Randy Moss\xe2\x80\x99 departure, he\xe2\x80\x99s eclipsed 250 passing yards (Week 6 vs. Bal) and thrown for multiple scores in a game (Week 9 at Cle) once. Owners who continue to trot Brady out on Sundays need to come to the realization he\xe2\x80\x99s in the same QB class as David Garrard, Josh Freeman and Donovan McNabb, a matchup-only play. This week the Brady bus of statistical mediocrity refuels in Pittsburgh. Over the past five weeks, the once invincible Steelers D has been exposed, surrendering 269.4 passing yards and 1.4 air scores per game. Vulnerable in the short-to-intermediate field, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been nickel-and-dimed to death. It may seem like the ideal scenario for Brady, but without much of a running game and explosive downfield weapons, the Steelers will likely tighten the screws defensively on the perimeter. Throw in a sprained foot, and the decorated passer is only useable in deeper formats. Smell the coffee. Possible QB Alternatives: David Garrard (vs. Hou), Ryan Fitzpatrick (vs. Det), Shaun Hill (at Buf), Joe Flacco (at Atl)'

S'This week, LT stands for \xe2\x80\x9cLight Total.\xe2\x80\x9d According to sources close to Jason LaCanfora, the Jets appear to be slowly phasing out Tomlinson\xe2\x80\x99s role as the primary rusher. Based on his string of vanilla performances over the past three weeks, a stretch in which he\xe2\x80\x99s averaged just 3.5 yards per carry and 82.3 total yards per game, the more effective Shonn Greene (5.0 ypc since Week 4) deserves a promotion. The future HOFer will still see plenty of work on third downs, but roughly 12-15 touches per game will likely become the norm, potentially crippling his value in non-PPR formats. Browns defensive coordinator Rob Ryan has done a masterful job revamping a defensive line that ranked 28th against the run a year ago. This season, Cleveland has yielded just one rushing touchdown and limited backs to only 4.0 yards per carry. Yes, the Jets boast arguably the league\xe2\x80\x99s best offensive line, but the Browns have allowed only one RB, Michael Turner in Week 5, to surpass 90 rushing yards. This week the geriatric back shows his age.'

S'Let\xe2\x80\x99s be frank about Jackson. He\xe2\x80\x99s an absolute warrior. If the Spartans employed him at the Battle of Thermopylae, \xe2\x80\x9c300\xe2\x80\x9d would have had a much happier ending. Despite his toughness, favorable workload and consistent double-digit fantasy performances, every once in a while he\xe2\x80\x99s shutdown. Week 10 could be one such instance. Fresh off the bye, the 49ers are determined to conquer the NFL\xe2\x80\x99s worst division, as most predicted preseason. San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s defensive strength is clearly in the trenches. On the year, the Gold Panners have allowed a mere 3.4 yards per carry, 129.5 total yards per game and three touchdowns to RBs equal to the eighth-fewest fantasy points. No rusher has reached the century mark against them. Jackson, who\xe2\x80\x99s tallied only 3.9 yards per tote, likely won\xe2\x80\x99t be the first. Because of his prominent role as a dump-off receiver, the Clydesdale is unbenchable in PPR leagues. But in standard, TD-heavy formats, he could sag. Patrick Willis has his number.'

S'To quote Beck, Forte\xe2\x80\x99s effort against the resurgent Vikings will be equivalent to \xe2\x80\x9cvoices of evil in a Bozo nightmare.\xe2\x80\x9d Yep, the Bears rusher will be a certifiable \xe2\x80\x9cLoser.\xe2\x80\x9d On the surface, what Forte has achieved fantasy-wise is truly remarkable. Despite averaging only 3.8 yards per carry and 16.6 touches per game, sporadic outbursts have skewed his perceived worth. Netting 13.5 points per week in standard formats, he currently ranks No. 12 among RBs, one spot ahead of The Burner. Still, this is a Bears offensive line that can\xe2\x80\x99t create a hole for a cockroach. The Williams Wall has shown signs of cracking, but the Vikes have conceded just 3.8 yards per carry and 127 total yards per game to tugboats. Forte has racked large chunks of yards running off left tackle (8.2 ypc), an area where the Vikings are exploitable. If Mike Martz chooses to run to that side, the volatile rusher could post decent numbers. However, last week\xe2\x80\x99s lame effort against the Bills (17 touches, 61 yards, 0 TDs) doesn\xe2\x80\x99t instill much confidence. Plus, Chester Taylor will continue to wrest away goal-line touches. Be bearish. Possible RB Alternatives: LeGarrette Blount (vs. Car), Thomas Jones (at Den), Fred Jackson (vs. Det),'

S'Loyal citizens of Fantasyland who support the Capital of Texas this week will be taxed \xe2\x80\xa6 heavily. A certain 38-year-old quarterback with a penchant for turnovers and sacks who operates behind a rickety offensive line will again hinder Austin\xe2\x80\x99s fantasy contributions. Against the Giants, an aggressive defense which ranks fourth in the league in sacks, Jon Kitna simply won\xe2\x80\x99t have the time to launch passes downfield, similar to what unfolded last week at Lambeau. The Packers pressured the pocket with much success, limiting the talented wideout to two catches for 16 yards without a touchdown. Even when the Giants have called off the dogs, the secondary has performed well. On the year, only four wideouts have recorded 70-yards or more in a game against corners Corey Webster and Terrell Thomas. In an apocalyptic season for the \xe2\x80\x98Boys, another asteroid hits the ground. Austin really should revisit Dr. Kardashian\xe2\x80\x99s clinic of curves to find solace.'

S'Too often this season, Marshall has brought NERF pistols, not Colt revolvers, to the gunfight. Yes, in PPR formats he\xe2\x80\x99s remained quite productive. He\xe2\x80\x99s currently on pace for 104 receptions and 1,236 yards. However, with only one touchdown on the season, the popular second-round pick has disappointed greatly in standard leagues. For conventional players, expect another bland effort. Miami has become the dysfunction junction of the South. Players on both sides of the ball, some apparently well-versed in feminine history, have outwardly voiced their frustration. Marshall has also expressed his displeasure. He should. Offensive coordinator Dan Henning could get out-coached by a 10-year-old in Madden. The changing of the Chads is a smart team move, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily rectify Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s value. Pennington is an intelligent, accurate passer with a noodle arm. Historically, downfield attempts have been an adventure. In order to find the end-zone, Marshall will have to do it on his own. Because of the QB\xe2\x80\x99s shortcomings and given the matchup, another uneventful tally (non-PPR) should be expected. Keep in mind No. 1 targets have averaged 63 yards per game and totaled only one touchdown against Cortland Finnegan this year. Possible WR Alternatives: Mike Sims-Walker, (vs. Hou), Derrick Mason (at Atl), Mike Williams, Sea (at Ari), Nate Washington (at Mia), Mike Thomas (vs. Hou), Steve Johnson (vs. Det)'

S"The rumors are true. Tebow was indeed conceived immaculately. He can heal the sick with one touch. And he can turn water into Apple Blossom Boone's Farm. Finally, The Mile High Messiah is back. Many owners, unable to separate fantasy from reality, have questioned Tebow's potential. After all, he's an inaccurate passer with flawed mechanics running a very conservative offense that just traded its top weapon, Brandon Lloyd, to St. Louis. Tebow believes his accuracy, footwork and general fundamentals have improved, but, based on his half of play against the Chargers, observations about his throwing motion still ring true. But because of his ability to chew up yards with his legs, he's a perfect fit for John Fox's run-first system, and a legit QB1 in fantasy formats. Yes, it was a different scheme, but keep in mind his 28.8 per game average over the final three weeks of 2010 topped the position. Denver will generally stick to its run-early, run-often philosophy, but this week, the Broncos might be more sky-minded. The Dolphins have yielded 8.5 yards per attempt, 293 passing yards and 2.0 touchdowns per game to opposing signal callers equal to the seventh-most fantasy points allowed. With the 'Fins, coincidentally enough, honoring the 2008 Florida National Championship team at halftime, it's only appropriate Tebow turns in a shining performance for the expected pro-Gators crowd. Kneel at the altar."

S'Screw Gettysburg. Jackie will soon be America\'s most famous Battle. The former special teamer, fourth on the Chiefs RB depth-chart entering the season, quickly ascended to the top of the pecking order after ripping off 140 total yards in Indy two weeks ago. In that game, Battle pounded the interior, displayed excellent speed and exhibited plus versatility. Earlier this week, Todd Haley said the newcomer "seized the opportunity." In true Samkon Gado style, he could be arguably the biggest surprise sensation of the fantasy season. Yes, Model T Thomas Jones and tweener Dexter McCluster will still be involved, but expect Battle to be the bell cow (15-18 carries) this week in Oakland, and possibly beyond. The Raiders\' D-line, tattooed routinely by opposing rushers, has given up 5.0 yards per carry, 173 total yards per game and six touchdowns to RBs this year equal to the fourth-most fantasy points allowed. Because the Silver and Black has also struggled against the pass, the Chiefs offense, as a whole, should strike a successful balance. Because of Battle\'s punishing, fall-forward style and favorable matchup, it\'s conceivable, he powers his way to borderline RB1 numbers in 12-teamers. KC, despite ranking sixth in the league in rushing yards per game, is the only club without a rushing touchdown on the year. This week will mark its first. Go to war.'

S'That loud banging noise you hear, it\'s the Noise slamming his head repeatedly on his keyboard. Speaking as a heavily invested Felix Jones owner (I should\'ve known better), Murray is must-add, and potentially, must-start material this week. After Felix was felled by a high ankle sprain last week in Foxboro, Murray and Tashard Choice carried the load. The former, who finished with 32 yards on 10 carries, ran strong on his first series but ultimately stagnated in the second-half, a performance the back admitted was just "all right." The rookie, a third-round pick in last April\'s draft, was a highly-regarded talent at Oklahoma. Though injury prone and lacking in the power department, he\'s an explosive, fall-forward rusher who\'s also a significant threat in the passing game \xe2\x80\x94 in many ways a Jones clone. Choice and possibly Philip Tanner, will also be rotated in, but Murray should tote the heavy-side of the timeshare this week against an exploitable St. Louis defense. The Rams have given up 5.2 yards per carry and 181 total yards per game to RBs this year equal to the fourth-most fantasy points allowed. Fred Jackson, LeSean McCoy and Frank Gore owners \xe2\x80\xa6 Cowboy up.'

S'Two weeks ago yours truly lampooned Brandon Funston\'s Baldwin recommendation against the Giants on "Fantasy Football Live." Much to my chagrin, his prediction couldn\'t have been more prophetic. Including his breakout 8-136-1 game in the Big Apple, the undrafted rookie from Stanford has greatly overachieved, eclipsing the 80-yard mark in three of his first five games. Tabbed by many scouts as "Bobby Engram with speed" the unheralded wideout is, as Pete Carroll describes him, a "really hard-nosed, competitive kid" with superb route-running skills and a high football I.Q. With Tarvaris Jackson expected to sit out, Charlie Whitehurst is will draw the start in Week 7. The instant chemistry he and Baldwin struck in New York should carry over to Cleveland. The Browns secondary, minus emerging shutdown corner Joe Haden again this week, is very vulnerable. Sheldon Brown, who will likely draw Baldwin, is very beatable. The often miffed corner checks in at No. 54 in pass coverage per Pro Football Focus. Wes Welker, DeSean Jackson and Jeremy Maclin supporters in dire straits for a bye-week filler should tickle the ivories of this Baldwin.'

S"For weeks it seems, the Prince of the Preseason has teetered on the brink of a Torrey Smith-esque breakout. However, after attracting just six total targets over the past two weeks (8.3 in Weeks 1-4), recent opportunities have been far and few between. But the young bud could finally bloom in the desert. A.J. Jefferson has defended passes fairly well this year, but teammates Patrick Peterson and Richard Marshall definitely haven't. The pair rank No. 80 and No. 84 respectively in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus. Because of Brown's elite speed and Ben Roethlisberger's big arm, the tandem could be an unstoppable connection. The Cardinals have surrendered the third-most 20-plus yard pass plays this year. And No. 3 targets have averaged a very healthy 69.0 yards per game against them. Throw in his scoring potential on special teams, and Brown is sure-fire WR3 in an excruciating bye week. Wear a hardhat."

S'Hello Spicoli. Painter, the butt of many jokes over the past couple weeks, has steadily improved with each start. As Austin Collie remarked earlier this week, "reps are Curtis\' friend right now." Unable to splash a canvas from five yards away three weeks ago in Tampa completing just 43.3 percent of his attempts, he has nailed targets at a 62.3 percent clip since.  Equally as important, he\'s thrown just one pick in four starts and routinely connected with speedster Pierre Garcon on a number of explosive pass plays. This week, expect him to reel in a bounty in the Bayou. Due to New Orleans\' questionable secondary, it\'s typically involved in shootouts. Only Jay Cutler and Blaine Gabbert failed to record multi-TD efforts against the Saints. On the year, they\'ve surrendered 275.3 passing yards and 2.0 passing touchdowns to QBs equal to the ninth-most fantasy points allowed. Because of the blitzing nature of Gregg Williams, formidable protection is a must for Painter. But if the Colts offensive line can stand its ground, he should post rich numbers against Jabari Greer and cohorts. In a game only a fantasy owner could love, Indy\'s Van Gogh could paint a masterpiece, especially for Tom Brady owners scrambling to find a serviceable filler. Hang him on your wall.'

S'A river may run through it, but if "it" is New York, quarterbacks be dammed. Darrelle Revis and Antonio Cromartie have lived up to their advanced billing as stalwarts. Only one quarterback, Tony Romo Week 1, has recorded a multi-TD performance against the Top Guns this season. Even the supposedly uncontainable Tom Brady failed to accomplish the feat. Overall, Rivers has underachieved somewhat through five games. The yards have been there (307 ypg), but his 6:7 TD:INT split has left a little to be desired. Considering the weakness of the Jets defense resides in the trenches (When Reggie Bush gashes you for 71 yards on 10 carries that says volumes about your problems), Norv Turner will likely lean heavily on his one-two ground punch of Ryan Mathews and Mike Tolbert. As well he should. The tandem is on pace to shatter Keith Byars and Terry Kirby\'s single season receiving yardage record for a duo in NFL history, a mark set all the way back when Snow was bumping your mix-tape (1993). Though check-downs will be prevalent, it\'s very possible the Chargers\' usual 52:48 pass-to-run split could be flipped. LaDainian Tomlinson\'s battle against his former team may dominate the headlines. But the Jets secondary is bound to steal the show. Even with Antonio Gates expected to back, Rivers is a shaky QB1 in Week 7. Keep in mind his best downfield weapon, Vincent Jackson, has been limited in practice this week by a nagging hamstring injury.'

S"Oompa Loompah doop-a-dee-do, those who start MJD better get a clue. The popular early-round pick is the undisputed centerpiece of a miserable offense that just reclaimed Mike Sims-Walker off waivers from St. Louis, a clear act of desparation. Jones-Drew, faced with several overloaded boxes this year, has earned a Purple Heart for his services, averaging 12.8 points per week, the 14th-best output among rushers. However, on pace for just 24 receptions, he's mysteriously been underutilized in the passing game, a strange occurrence with rookie Blaine Gabbert under center. Recall just three seasons ago he hauled in 62 balls. Against Baltimore's aggressive pass rush one would assume he might take on a larger role in the vertical game, but, even if he does, MJD will be contained. Overall, Ray Lewis and friends have limited RBs to just 3.3 yards per carry, 99.8 total yards per game and one touchdown, equal to the second-fewest fantasy points allowed. And that was achieved against the likes of Rashard Mendenhall, Chris Johnson, Steven Jackson and Arian Foster. Yes, he'll get his customary 20-25 touches, but don't expect a sweet-tasting finish."

S"Traditionally, defenses could shoot, stab, electrocute, dismember, feed to Zanesville's un-caged menagerie, the Rasputin of the NFL, but he would still find a way to total at least 90 yards. Last week versus Green Bay is a prime example. Against the fourth unfriendliest run defense in the league Jackson racked 129 total yards. Faced with another daunting matchup, a similar scenario could unfold this week in Big D. However, with Sam Bradford handicapped by a high ankle sprain and because St. Louis' poor run-blocking remains unresolved, the workhorse will likely struggle. DeMarcus Ware and company are extremely athletic and active in the box. Their ability to snuff out the run is nearly unmatched. Only San Francisco and Baltimore have yielded fewer fantasy points to rushers this season. The 'Boys, giving up just 3.3 yards per carry, have yet to allow a running back to surpass 60 yards on the ground or 85 yards in total. Without question, Jackson is a fighter, but because of the Rams' defensive shortcomings and weak offensive punch, the rusher could be down for the count early. Bank on him only as a back-end RB2 in deeper leagues."

S'Stud theorists would maintain to never, ever, under any circumstance, designate a proven wideout a "Lame" no matter how intimidating the matchup. Though that may be true, the bigger question remains: Is the not-so-Hot Roddy still an elite wide receiver? Based on his No. 30 ranking among WRs (per game average), he\'s only a mid-tiered WR3. The reasons for White\'s early season downfall are twofold: 1) Julio Jones has wrested away a sizable chunk of targets, 2) The Falcons offensive line has underperformed, leading to more Matt Ryan sacks and thus less production downfield. Understandably, White, a player who typically wears emotions on his sleeve, has outwardly expressed his frustration, flagged for personal fouls in consecutive games. Eventually, he\'ll snap out of it, but don\'t expect a reversal of fortune this week in Motown. Lions corner Chris Houston has played well this season, holding No. 1 targets to a marginal 67.1 yards per game. In fact, only three receivers (Dwayne Bowe, Michael Jenkins and Laurent Robinson) have eclipsed the 80-yard mark against Detroit this year. With or without Julio, this Dirty Bird may stay grounded.'

S"Among Green Bay's superbly talented receiving corps, Greg Jennings, deserves the utmost adulation, rightfully so. However, Nelson, a true consistency king, also should be showered in praise. Despite netting just 5.1 targets per game, the deep threat checks in at No. 16 among WRs in per game average, sandwiched between more ballyhooed targets Larry Fitzgerald and Dez Bryant. Long, explosive pass plays is the backbone of Jordy's game. Three of his four scores have occurred on connections of 50 or more yards. In bonus leagues he's absolutely money. But this week he may only be worth pocket change. Cover 2 defenses, a scheme that usually stamps out big vertical plays, has wreaked havoc on the 26-year-old. The Bears limited him to just three catches for 40 in Week 4. And last year against the Vikes, Nelson caught seven passes for only 45 yards. He also failed to score. With or without Antoine Winfield, Chris Cook and Cedric Grifin, each ranked inside the top-20 in the league in coverage according to Pro Football Focus, should be able to stand their ground. Hold the Gouda."

S'Most would rather trust Jason Garrett with late-game clock management than put faith in a turnover prone QB known for titanic meltdowns to advance them into Round 2, but the chastised passer may actually be a difference-maker. And, before you ask, yes, the Noise is slightly delusional. In all seriousness, suggesting Grossman could finish as a QB1 this week in 12-teamers isn\'t farfetched. Ignoring his tainted name, the \'Skins slinger has performed fairly well since retaking the starting job from John Beck. In four starts, he\'s averaged 260.5 yards per game and posted a 5:6 td:int split (one rush td). His subsequent 18.8 per game mark in standard formats is the 15th-best among QBs during that span. The expected loss of Fred Davis to suspension is a killer, but with Santana Moss, Jabar Gaffney and check-down maestro Roy Helu in tow, Grossman has plenty of weapons in the arsenal. Corner Kyle Arrington, the NFL\'s interceptions leader, deserves a hat-tip for his execution, but the rest of the Patriots secondary is epically bad. The battered unit is on pace to establish a rather dubious record. An astounding nine QBs have thrown for at least 300 yards against them, including the likes of Chad Henne, Jason Campbell, Mark Sanchez and Dan Orlovsky. Simply, New England has put lipstick on many pigs. Sanchez in Week 5 and Tyler Palko in Week 11 are the only two passers not to eclipse the 20-point threshold against it. With the \'Skins out of playoff contention, Grossman admitted he and his teammates are trying to "put a show on for the fans." Considering the defensively inept opponent, the FedEx faithful, and dice-rolling owners, will definitely feel entertained.'

S'Gerhart, a cross between Peyton Hillis, James Starks and an Alaskan moose, is an underrated commodity poised to deliver his third consecutive noteworthy performance. He may lack qualities that typically drive owner libidos wild (e.g. explosiveness and open-field wiggle),  but he\'s a classic between-the-tackles grinder who\'s also blessed with tacky hands and pile-moving power. Last week in the lead role, he grabbed eight passes and rolled up 133 total yards versus the Von Miller-less Broncos. Against a Detroit defense also minus its defensive star, Ndamukong Suh, he could replicate that success. According to Leslie Frazier Adrian Peterson is "very close" to returning from a high ankle sprain, but the former rush king could be held back considering Minnesota has zero to play for. If the Purple Hey-Zeus is again deactivated, Gerhart is a strong candidate for another top-20 performance. The Lions, even with Suh in the lineup, have allowed 4.6 yards per carry to rushers this season. Mark Ingram and Darren Sproles each surpassed the 10-point threshold against them in Week 13. Because of his questionable pass-blocking, Vikes\' offensive Coordinator Bill Musgrave doesn\'t have complete faith in Gerhart in most passing situations. Last week, he didn\'t see a single third-down snap after halftime. However, because of his scoring versatility, useful matchup and likely bell cow role, the former Stanford standout is bound to fly high.'

S"If the loss of Jay Cutler killed the Bears, Matt Forte's exit officially shipped them to the taxidermist. Though Chicago is still in the wildcard hunt, its playoff hopes could permanently slip away with one more defeat. Not even Barbra Favre could save it. Still, Barber, once an RB2 staple on rosters during his heyday in Dallas, boasts considerable fantasy value. Lovie Smith may believe Khalil Bell possesses more Forte-like qualities than Barber, but the latter is the stronger candidate for the lion's share of touches. The veteran isn't the nimblest or fastest of players, but he, like Gerhart, is a gritty interior runner. With an expanded workload, it's conceivable he could post back-end RB2 numbers in 12-teamers. Denver, which could again be without the services of its best run defender, Miller, could be extremely vulnerable up front. Even with the rookie sensation on the field, its struggled stuffing the run. Since Week 10 the Broncos have surrendered 4.5 yards per carry and the seventh-most fantasy points to RBs. Yes, Caleb Hanie's ineffectiveness is a worry and Bell will likely wrest away 8-12 touches, but The Barbarian should wield a sharpened axe in Denver."

S"Penalties, dropped passes, mental lapses, injuries \xe2\x80\x94 Jones appears to have slammed face-first into the rookie wall. Limited by a hamstring setback over the past few weeks, he hasn't registered a top-40 effort since exploding for 131 yards and two touchdowns at Indy in Week 9. To his frustrated owners, the statistical vanishing act has labeled him untrustworthy. But finally healthy, it's time for the thoroughbred to get back on track. Place a bet down on him this week against the Pansies, and he's destined to cash. Carolina corner Captain Munnerlyn, presumably the overseer of the U.S.S. Suck, has been one of the league's most abused defenders. Picked on repeatedly by quarterbacks, for good reason, the DB has allowed a staggering 71.7 catch percentage and 14.3 yards per catch. Despite his miscues, Jones still attracted 10 targets from Matt Ryan last week in Houston. If he garners a similar workload, which seems likely with Chris Gamble expected to shadow Roddy White, he could finally regain the confidence of his owners. Keep in mind the Pansies have conceded the eighth-most fantasy points to WRs since Week 10. Bank on him."

S"The obvious drawback to any ground and pound scheme is handcuffing tight ends to the line of scrimmage. Keller should know. With Rex Ryan desperate to resuscitate a flatlined run game, the oversized target experienced a terrible midseason drought. From Weeks 4-11, he failed to find the end-zone even once and netted just 2.8 receptions and 37.7 receiving yards per game. Mark Sanchez, who Keller has vehemently defended, also bears partial responsibility for the downturn, but, regardless who's to blame, it's a travesty a weapon with such incredible natural tools is so heavily underused in the passing game. That could change this week against KC. Defending the middle of the field has been quite a chore for the Chiefs. On the year, they've given up the third-most fantasy points to TEs. Scott Chandler, Anthony Fasano and Visanthe Shiancoe are just a few unheralded names that severely wounded Todd Haley's bunch between the hashmarks. If Keller can break away from the box roughly 7-9 times, he should be in store for a memorable afternoon. Purchase a ticket."

S'Over the years, several unpredictable RBs have emerged from the woodworks in December and become playoff heros. Nick Goings, Ron Dayne and Lee Suggs donned a cape. Saine could too. James Starks, nursing an ankle injury, isn\'t expected to suit up, swinging open the door of opportunity for the virtual unknown. The product from Ohio State, overlooked in last April\'s NFL draft, isn\'t your typical rookie free agent. As Packers running backs coach Jerry Fontenot recently said, he\'s an "impressive" young back with "efficient running skills," speed and versatility. In fact, Aaron Rogers remarked Saine has the best hands on the entire Packers roster. Because Green Bay is overloaded with extraordinary receivers, that\'s quite the compliment. In last week\'s thriller in New York, the youngster played well, totaling 45 yards on 10 touches (22 snaps). Ryan Grant should be the primary early-down runner against Oakland and John Kuhn will undoubtedly vulture goal-line carries, but Saine is in line to total a 12-15 touch workload, many of those grips coming in the pass game. The Raiders, who\'ve allowed 4.9 yards per carry to RBs this year, are awful defending the run. Eight RBs have scored double-digits against them in standard leagues. That number is significantly higher in PPR formats. Yes, the Packers are a pass-first team, but if you\'re hard-pressed for a flex option, don\'t fear the unknown. Saine could cure your PPR pain.'

S'Rashard Mendenhall is sure to bring his "A" game against the AFC\'s third-friendliest run defense, a potential outcome that could doom Big Ben\'s Week 14 value. Roethlisberger has quietly cranked out a 20.4 per week tally on the year, the 10th-best mark among passers. However, he\'s endured a mini-slump over the past three weeks, failing to register 17 fantasy points in a game. Blame the downturn on poor pass protection. During that stretch Big Ben has been dragged to the turf eight times. Yes, the Browns don\'t boast a formidable pass rush (1.9 sacks/game) and its top-ranking in pass defense is a bit skewed \xe2\x80\x94 Joe Haden and friends have yet to face a quarterback the caliber of No. 7 \xe2\x80\x94 but since Scott Fujita landed on injured reserve, the Chihuahua\'s already soft run D has reeled. Only the sword-less Bucs have allowed more points to RBs since Week 10. Combine that with Bruce Arians\' strong desire to improve the run game and a ground-heavy approach, similar to what Baltimore deployed last week in C-Town, seems likely. Express trepidation. Rex Grossman, Carson Palmer and Matt Moore are more attractive plays.'

S'Assumption is powerful form of persuasion that can often lead the flock astray. Gore\'s matchup against the league\'s 19th-ranked run defense is a prime example. The Niners\' newest all-time leading rusher, who Jim Harbaugh apparently wants a life-size statue erected of (Sidebar: Gore in carbonite? Han Solo-style?), has managed to fend off his yearly visit to the infirmary averaging 11.5 points per game in standard leagues, good for 17th among qualifying backs. However, most of his production came midseason when he strung together five consecutive 100-yard games. Since Week 10, Gore, slowed by a bruised knee and two sore ankles, has contributed minimally. During that stretch, he\'s not crossed the chalk and has averaged a mere 55.8 total yards per game and 3.1 yards per carry, including a yawn-worthy 92-1-0 line against the Cardinals in Week 10. Arizona, like Seattle and Denver, is a completely different defensive animal at home. In the creature comforts of the UPS only Steven Jackson has eclipsed the 40-yard rush mark against it. Overall, the Desert Birds have allowed just 3.6 yards per carry to RBs in Glendale. Harbaugh vowed earlier this week he won\'t rest his starters, but given Gore\'s sharp decline in production and beaten body his touch total may decrease somewhat down the homestretch. Match that with the difficult matchup, and he\'s Grade A "Lame" material in Week 14.'

S"To put it mildly, Greene is to fantasy running backs what Bakersfield, Calif. is to excitement. Speaking as an owner (Note: Trading Jimmy Graham to the Piano Man for said RB's services early this season was a grave mistake), the man doesn't exactly push the needle. Outside of his near 30-point explosion last week, clearly his finest single-game performance of his career, he's offered very little. Since Week 6, he's scored just one other time and eclipsed the century mark once. To be fair, the Jets have grounded and pounded with renewed success of late. Over his past six contests, Greene is averaging a stout 4.7 yards per carry. With that in mind, this week's home matchup with the Chiefs, a defense that's conceded the fourth-most rushing yards per game (123.6, 4.4 ypc to RBs) during the past five weeks, would seem enticing. But just when you think Greene is poised for a breakout run, he crushes your soul with a 25-80-0 effort or, better yet, a game-ending injury. Yes, the vanilla rusher's hefty workload makes him a fine flex option in 12-teamers, but trust him as an RB2 and he'll likely show your team the door."

S'Listening to "American Pie," AKA "The Song that Never Ends," sober. That will seem a less cruel punishment for owners who choose to roll with Boldin this week. Mired in a deep funk, the wideout has fallen on hard times. Since Week 10, he\'s found the end-zone just once and has hauled in a lowly 2.3 receptions and 38.0 yards per game. The main reason for the recent slide is simple: the Ravens have gotten back doing what they do best, pounding opponents into oblivion via the run. Over that span, Cam Cameron, who seemingly abandoned the ground game at times midseason, has called "pass" just 37.5 percent of the time, an old school mentality John Fox could appreciate. As a result, Boldin has worked primarily as a downfield blocker, sealing off defenders for Ray Rice and Ricky Williams. The receiver\'s mysterious case of Crisco hands is also to blame. On the season he\'s dropped eight passes and caught just 53.8 percent of intended passes, the 83rd-best mark among WRs. No doubt, Indy\'s secondary is hurting. The loss of Jerraud Powers last week to a season-ending knee injury further crippled an already miserable unit. The matchup is ripe, but given the ultra-conservative state of the Ravens offense, a large helping of Rice should be expected. Count on Boldin only as a WR3 in deeper leagues.'

S'Trusting a receiver in his first game back after missing extensive time with a hamstring injury is senseless. Only the acts of Carmen Sandiego\'s arch-nemesis, the Big East Conference, which perplexingly added San Diego St., Boise St., Houston and SMU to its membership this week, are more illogical. Wednesday Maclin returned to a full practice and reported no repercussions afterwards, noting he felt good. Despite the positive admission, he\'s one to express caution over this week. As we\'ve seen countless times this season (e.g. Peyton Hillis, Miles Austin, Arian Foster and Andre Johnson), hamstring injuries are fickle in nature. One minute you\'re running like a gazelle. The next, you\'re limping like a wounded wildebeest. The risks involved are hard to ignore. Without question, Maclin\'s matchup is favorable. His likely shadow, Sean Smith, ranks 106th out of 107 among corners in coverage according to Pro Football Focus. The badgered DB has given up a 61.2 catch percentage and the seventh-most yards. If operating at full-speed, the potential is there for Maclin to have a monster day. However, the rust he and Michael Vick accumulated while sidelined could weigh heavily. That combined with his strong odds of re-injury suggest to play it safe with someone else, especially in shallow leagues. *Expect that start percentage to climb into the necessary "Lames" criteria by Sunday.'

S"Someone, anyone please slip a packet of laxatives into Mike Munchak's Christmas cookies. That way, the coach can expel every last bit of Matt Hasselbeck crap holed up in his body. The head coach's unwavering devotion to the veteran is dumbfounding. Hassy, ineffective last week against woeful Indianapolis, was, again, completely outclassed by the younger, more exuberant Locker. The rookie isn't the most accurate passer, but his energy, vocal leadership, cannon arm and mobility are infectious. When he's entered games, the Titans' offense has come to life, evident in his fourth quarter showing last week in Indy (11-16, 108-1-9). Stubbornly, Munchak still refuses to fully embrace the rookie telling the Tennessean Monday Hasselbeck, despite throwing two interceptions, didn't deserve any blame for Sunday's embarrassing loss. At this point, he's still backing Hassy, but it could be early-week gamesmanship. With support for the coach shrinking faster than Tennessee's playoff hopes, Munchak needs to take a page out of John Fox's playbook and succumb to fan demands. If he does have a change of heart, Locker is a sensational play against a Jags defense decimated by injuries. Corners Drew Coleman and Ashton Youboty, burned often by Roddy White and Julio Jones last week, are a very exploitable pair. Once an unyielding bunch against the pass, Jacksonville has given up 7.5 yards per attempt and 19.3 fantasy points per game (standard formats) to QBs since Week 12. Because of the youngster's running abilities and rocket arm, he's a poor man's version of Cam Newton or Michael Vick. Give him an opportunity, and he very well could lead you to the Promised Land. That is, if Santa Claus gifts Munchak a clue."

S"On Christmas night, look for Bell to mix-n-mingle in his jingling feet. Last week against Seattle, the undrafted UCLA product showed the world he was good at catching the football, a skill, he noted post-game, only his mom believed he possessed. Bell completely outplayed Marion Barber who was still reeling from his disastrous finish in Denver two weeks ago. The backup flashed not only sticky fingers, but excellent burst in the ground game. A true downhill runner, he picked up tough yards between the tackles, tallying 4.3 yards per carry against the 'Hawks' generally inflexible D. Overall, he totaled 108 yards with a receiving touchdown, playing 45 of 63 snaps. That performance, according to the Chicago Tribune, could net him the start against Green Bay. Versatile rusher's have paid their owners considerable cheddar when matched against the Packers. Clay Mathews and company have allowed 6.5 receptions and 54.5 receiving yards per game to RBs this year, the most in Fantasyland. Matt Forte snagged seven passes for 80 yards in the rivals' first meeting. Because of Bell's chemistry with fellow second-teamer Caleb Hanie, Green Bay's unwillingness to defend the flat and the likely play-from-behind element, the Week 15 wonder could wow again, especially in PPR leagues. Jingle around the clock. (UPDATE: Josh McCown is expected to start over Hanie according to ESPN Chicago. McCown stinks, but Bell should remain the centerpiece of Mike Martz's offensive game-plan.)"

S'Quietly, Stew Beef has matured into a quality all-around back. Rarely deployed as a receiver during his days at Oregon and first three seasons with the Panthers, the rusher has, as Cam Newton revealed last week, "negotiated his way" into a larger role in the pass game. With 395 receiving yards on the season, he\'s now the franchise\'s all-time leader in the category, breaking Nick Going\'s team-record from 2004 last week in Houston. Also making strides as a pass blocker, he\'s truly developed into a well-rounded force. This week against the sword-less Bucs, he should maximize he newfound skills. In the clubs\' first clash back in Week 13, Stewart powered his way to 99 total yards and a touchdown, averaging 5.7 yards per carry. Though he\'ll continue to split snaps with DeAngelo Williams, the fourth-year back is a solid bet for at least 15 touches. Tampa is the league\'s most generous run defense giving up 4.8 yards per carry, 173 total yards and 1.4 touchdowns per game to RBs. Since Week 7, a span of eight games, nine backs have eclipsed the 12-point mark against it. Count on him as a RB2.'

S"Thomas, a disciple of the Mile High Messiah, has become an integral part of Denver's vertical game. Just a few short weeks ago that certainly wasn't the case. Plagued by a crippling bout of banana hands, the wideout struggled with poor body-positioning, which led to a number of botched opportunities. However, he and Tim Tebow, have shown more consistency of late, indicative in their bubbling chemistry. Over the past three weeks, Thomas has averaged 11 targets per game. In total, he's contributed 17.3 points per week during that stretch (112.7 yards per game), placing him on top of the WR throne in that category. At 6-foot-3, 229-pounds, Thomas is quite the physical specimen. His blend of size, strength and speed are reminiscent of his predecessor, Brandon Marshall. Facing a Buffalo defense fresh off giving up 84 yards and a TD to B-Marsh, the carbon-copy could inflict similar damage. According to Pro Football Focus, Drayton Florence and Aaron Williams rank 67th and 84th, respectively, in coverage. Each has given up a catch rate well above 60-percent. Tebow is always a bit of an adventure throwing the ball, but expect the QB and Thomas to connect early and often. Slide him into the WR2 spot in all leagues."

S'Philly\'s Mack Daddy, wiggity-wiggity-wiggity-wiggity wack since Week 10, will finally make his owners "Jump, Jump." Maclin, hampered by hamstring and shoulder setbacks, emerged from Week 15\'s smashing of the Jets unscathed. He played 49 of 62 snaps, his most action since Week 9. Though his final fantasy line was far from earth-shattering (3-57-0), he definitely took a step in the right direction. This week, in a must-win matchup against Dallas, the wideout has strong odds of logging his finest fantasy performance since he totaled 11.4 fantasy points against the \'Boys eight weeks ago. Dallas could be without top corner Mike Jenkins who is dealing with a separated shoulder. If the starter sits, Maclin could give sketchy backup Orlando Scandrick fits. Receivers have caught 67.9-percent of their targets against the lowly DB. Because the Eagles\' playoff hopes are very much alive and with Michael Vick looking healthy, Maclin is a strong bounce back candidate. Throw in Philly\'s shortcomings on defense and Tony Romo\'s scorching hand, and a shootout is very likely to break out in Big D, enhancing the receiver\'s scoring potential. Wiggle and shake your rump.'

S"Unwanted in Denver, Orton looks to have planted firm roots with the Chiefs, just weeks after his release. In last week's jaw-dropper at Arrowhead, he showed great command of the offense, made crisp, accurate throws and played mistake-free football toppling the defending World Champs from the ranks of the unbeaten, an impressive performance. Doing his best Aaron Rodgers impersonation, he also spread the wealth, connecting on pass plays of 10-plus yards with eight different receivers. After his standout effort, interim head coach, and full-time Weeble Wobble, Romeo Crennel, said Orton needs to be the starter entering 2012, if he leads the Chiefs to victory over the final two weeks. That challenge combined with KC's still flickering playoff hopes should motivate the passer to perform. Don't expect him to crack under the pressure. Outside Stanford Routt, Oakland is extremely vulnerable in downfield coverage. Tyvon Branch, Michael Huff and, especially, Lito Sheppard, have struggled matching strides with their assignments. Though they've surrendered just 6.8 yards per attempt, 12 quarterbacks have eclipsed the 20-point mark against them this season, including Orton, then a Bronco, in Week 1 (304-1-1-13). There's serious potential here. If Munchak is indeed not playing with a full deck, the veteran is a useful consolation prize off waivers if Locker sits."

S"No one should touch Eli with a thirty-nine-and-a-half-foot pole. Little Cindy Lou Who would agree. Prior to last week's catastrophic, 257-0-3 choke job against a Redskins defense that was torched by Tom Brady the week before, the junior Manning was having his finest fantasy season yet. His 24.3 points per week output was the sixth-best at his position, ranking above higher-priced commodities Tony Romo, Michael Vick and Philip Rivers. Eli notched 10 multi-TD performances in 13 games. Sadly, with the pressure-cooker cranked to 11, he cracked. Misreads, misconnections, missed opportunities \xe2\x80\x94 the $100 million man simply folded. Hakeem Nicks also deserves considerable blame. His miserable 9.8-point performance in traditional formats eliminated many. Those lucky enough to survive the Manning meltdown, should keep the QB's cheeks firmly planted on the bench. The Jets secondary is far from invincible. Three passers since Week 10 (Tom Brady, Ryan Fitzpatrick and Michael Vick) took the unit to task, each surpassing the 25-point barrier. Still, Darrelle Revis and company have given up just 6.6 yards per attempt during that stretch. With playoff aspirations on the line for both teams, expect the signal caller to crumble under the heat of an agressive Jets pass rush. New York's Mr. Grinch is indeed as cuddly as a cactus."

S'Most weeks Peterson is fantasy\'s Abominable Snowman of the North. But this week in Washington he\'ll be, as the great Yukon Cornelius would say, one "Humble Bumble." Leslie Frazier, his team buried under an avalanche of points by visiting New Orleans last week, kept the former rush king under wraps, much to the RB\'s dismay. In total, Peterson touched the rock just 10 times, ripping off 60 yards. Toby Gerhart actually played two more snaps than the incumbent. Peterson, understandably not the jolliest of elves post-game, noted he was prepared to handle a rigorous workload and was upset by the outcome. However, he also admitted he wasn\'t operating at "full-speed." His owners, infuriated by yet another Peterson fantasy playoff letdown, lashed out at the top pick via Twitter. Peterson\'s response: "Go kick rocks." Guess Adrian didn\'t want to appease the fantasy community after all. Purple Jesus Jerk. A more substantial workload is likely this week, but isn\'t guaranteed. Clearly, his ankle sprain isn\'t fully healed. Washington, showing more inflexibility against the run, is also a stiffer opponent than most think. Over the past five weeks, the \'Skins have given up just 3.9 yards per carry to RBs. Toss in the likelihood Minnesota plays from behind, and it\'s conceivable Peterson disappoints again. Exercise caution. Seriously.'

S"The Burner, bothered by nagging groin injuries, has failed to kick on the turboboosters of late, routinely plodding into the fray for minimal gains. Over his past four games, he's tallied just 3.3 yards per carry. Eleven days off should help heal any lingering wounds, but Atlanta's recent poor run-blocking doesn't bode well for an immediate turnaround. At 29, it appears Turner has started down the path of deterioration, a journey many prominent rushers experienced at a similar juncture in their careers. Slowly rotting away, he hasn't seen 40 snaps in a game since Week 12. As a result, Mike Mularkey could lean on younger, more exuberant backs Jason Snelling and Jacquizz Rodgers down the stretch. The Saints are generally resistless up front.  They've surrendered 5.1 yards per carry to RBs on the year. But many backs, like Peterson last week, have fallen victim to the scoreboard. Large insurmountable leads built up by Drew Brees have forced offensive coordinators to abandon the run much earlier than anticipated. This is a factor that plays into every New Orleans matchup, even against a quality opponent. In the teams' first clash in Week 10, the Falcons kept it close, which allowed Turner to be active for most of the game. That week he totaled a handsome 106 yards. But with the encore set for the Superdome, the points disparity should be much wider, making the Burner a very risky option."

S"Down on the depth chart to begin the year, Helu has staked his claim as Lucifer's premier featured back. A tough interior runner with plus speed and sensational hands, he has become one of the virtual game's best all-around producers. Extrapolate what the rookie has accomplished in five starts (130.2 total yards per game, two TDs) over a full 16-game slate (2,032 total yards, seven TDs), and he would easily be one of the top-three rushers in fantasy, particularly in PPR formats. Without question, he will be the subject of much discussion, in terms of draft position, come August. Shanahan understands his long-term potential. That is exactly why Helu, limited by a toe and ankle injuries last week against the Giants, may see a decrease in touches over the final two weeks. With the 'Skins out of the playoff hunt, Evan Royster, who totaled a season-high 10 carries last week, could be evaluated further. Helu's setback couldn't come at a more inopportune time. Washington hosts a Minnesota defense that's yielded 164 total yards per game and four touchdowns since Week 11, equal to the eighth-most fantasy points allowed. The youngster, averaging an exhausting 27.2 touches per game over the past five weeks, may net a 10-12 touch reduction this week, especially given the Vikings' derelict efforts against the pass. With championship dreams on the line, Helu is nothing more than a flex option in 12-team leagues."

S'Socialism is starting to take hold in Dallas. Don\'t tell Rick Perry. With all parts finally healthy, the Cowboys\' offense has taken on a Saints-like identity. Romo, the Karl Marx of Big D, has spread the wealth accurately and efficiently. Over the past three weeks only Brees, Rodgers, Brady and Cam have been better fantasy-wise. Though Dez has also performed admirably during that stretch and beyond -- he\'s scored in five of his past six games -- the talented wideout hasn\'t exactly delivered in the receptions department. He\'s attracted six targets or fewer in three of his last four. And since Week 11, he\'s grabbed five or more balls in a game only once. The return of Miles Austin combined with Romo\'s affections for Laurent Robinson have evened out the targets distribution. Dez did little in his last meeting with the Eagles, catching three passes for just 28 yards. Robinson was the fantasy hero in that game. But with Romo fully healthy and Austin in uniform, circumstances are different this time around. Still with Asante Samuel "ready to go" after tweaking his hammy last week, it could be another dull performance for the Dallas star. Secondary targets are averaging just 50.2 yards per game against Philly. Considering the enormity of the game in terms of playoff leverage, it wouldn\'t be at all surprising if Andy Reid\'s bunch, for once, rises to the occasion. Be worried Dez owners. Be very worried.'

S"In Chicago's throttling of Atlanta last week, Jay Cutler's fantasy contributions were anything but bearish. The smug QB surpassed the 300-yard mark and tossed a pair of touchdowns, presumably inflating his already enormous ego to George Clooney proportions. His odds of duplicating that production this week appear strong. Granted it was Aaron Rodgers, but the New Orleans secondary, torched repeatedly by Jordy Nelson and Greg Jennings, looked very average in the opener. There are no targets on Chicago's roster that remotely resemble either Packers' talent level, but, in what should be a shootout in the Superdome, Cutler will likely deliver big numbers. Keep in mind the Saints allowed 8.9 yards per attempt to Rodgers last week. Yes, Gregg Williams will throw everything and the kitchen sink at the signal caller. Last week, the Falcons forced Cutler to the turf five times. But if he receives at least adequate protection, favorable fantasy results are bound to follow. Trust him as a QB1 in 12-team and deeper leagues."

S"Three years ago when Williams suffered his second patella tendon tear most believed he was on the verge of being buried at Cadillac Ranch. But after catching 46 passes last season in Tampa, the same number current teammate Steven Jackson totaled last year with the Rams, this ride showed he had plenty left in the tank. With S-Jax likely out due to a strained quad, it's time for Caddy to build on his surprising effort against the Eagles (140 total yards on 25 touches).  The Giants, sans starters Justin Tuck, Osi Umenyiora and Jonathan Goff last week, did a remarkable job keeping Tim Hightower in check. Although the 'Skins back finished with a quality fantasy day, his 2.7 yards per carry was appalling. Minus Danny Amendola and with Sam Bradford banged up, many would automatically assume Williams is a flex-only play given the matchup. But he showed considerable power last week, racking 53 yards after contact. By sheer attrition he has excellent odds of racking around 100 total yards. And that could be a conservative estimate. If Bradford exploits NY's weakened secondary, he could flirt with the century mark on the ground alone. Because of his versatile skill set, entrenched third-down role and spike in carries, he's a back-end RB2 in 12-teamers, especially in PPR formats."

S"Even a certain chemically-altered gumshoe and his talking dog could solve the mystery of the Packers' backfield after watching the season opener. It's obvious the talent gap between Starks and rapidly aging veteran Ryan Grant is wider than B.J. Raji's badonkadonk. The youngster, though slower than most featured backs, exhibited more power and burst shedding would-be Saints tacklers en route to a 57-yard, one-TD effort. Amazingly, 48 of those yards came after contact. Post-game Mike McCarthy admitted Starks deserved more touches, a hint of what could unfold moving forward. Against Carolina that desire will likely be carried out. The centerpiece of the Carolina defense, linebacker Jon Beason, was lost for the season after snapping his achilles last week in Arizona. Already suspect on the ground with their defensive leader \xe2\x80\x94 Beanie Wells rolled his way to a top-10 RB tally last week \xe2\x80\x94 the Panthers are now extremely vulnerable between-the-tackles in his absence. Grant will still be involved in some capacity, probably netting roughly 30-35% of the touches, but Starks is in position to establish his rightful claim as the lead horse. On roughly 15-20 carries, anticipate top-20 numbers"

S'The mental, and we can only presume, physical scars Burress received while imprisoned for two years in upstate New York were thought to have taken quite a toll. As a result, many owners purposely avoided the wideout on draft day, a glaring oversight. Against the Terence Newman-less Cowboys Sunday night, Burress flashed vintage form, hauling in four catches for 72 yards and a score. This week, with an equally favorable matchup, his output could be just as outstanding. Defensively, Jacksonville picked up exactly where it left off from 2010, giving up explosive pass plays (7.7 ypa). Last week, Kenny Britt and Nate Washington combined for 203 yards against the Jags, averaging a ridiculous 18.3 yards per catch. With a noticeable size advantage over dinged corner Derek Cox, who is one of the league\'s worst DBs when healthy, Plax should solidify his standing as a borderline WR2/3. He may indeed be a "space cadet," but for those that picked him up on the cheap, he\'s well on his way to turning a galactic profit.'

S"When compared to Megatron, Burleson is R2-D2 in terms of overall talent. But the veteran, a key figure in an explosive passing offense, is anything but a bucket of bolts. Week 1 at Tampa, he compiled a serviceable five catches for 60 yards on five targets. He also chipped in a 20-yard run. Burleson, a smooth route runner who thrives near the goal-line, should produce fruitful numbers in the encore. The devastating loss of Eric Berry to a torn ACL has the Chiefs defense, a unit that allowed four TDs to Ryan Fitzpatrick last week, reeling. Without its leader and best downfield defender, KC is no match for the Lions' high-powered passing attack. Calvin Johnson is the unquestioned apple of Matthew Stafford's eye, but with coverage rotating to the Pro Bowler's side, Burleson has a great chance to win many one-on-one battles with Brandon Carr. Start him with confidence as a WR3 in competitive formats."

S"Whether seen in politics or sports, Washington typically is an unforgiving place where reputations are chewed up, spit out then urinated on. However, for the suddenly sexy Rexy, the nation's capital could be the location of a surprising career rebirth. Coming off a sensational 305-yard, 2-TD performance against the rival Giants, Grossman is poised to not only duplicate, but exceed his opening week stat line. To put it kindly, Arizona is an abomination against the pass. Rookies Patrick Peterson and A.J. Jefferson were humiliated by Carolina last week as Cam Newton threw for 422 yards and two TDs, shattering Peyton Manning's record for most passing yards in a rookie debut. Yes, Grossman will take a bad sack or three. And he will always be a magnet for turnovers. But he made several quality throws last week, delivering several on-the-money passes to Santana Moss, Anthony Armstrong and the very underrated Fred Davis. Considering the issues 'Zona had defending Steve Smith, who is a similarly styled receiver as Moss, it's fathomable Grossman's final Week 2 rank will come close to matching his jersey number. Sound the sax, Rex will most certainly be in effect against the Cards."

S"Entering the season, Miami's secondary was expected to be its strength. According to Pro Football Focus, the Fins ranked fourth in pass rush and 13th in defending pass attempts. However, sent to the cannery by Tom Brady in opening week action to the tune of 517 yards and four touchdowns, many have questioned the true legitimacy of corners Vontae Davis and Sean Smith. Recall last year, the duo limited passers to the 10th fewest fantasy points. Still, they are better than what they showed Week 1. Schaub, the victim of a lopsided early spread versus Indy, disappointed last week finishing No. 25 among passers in points. Though his numbers should improve, don't anticipate a killer day. Based on the matchup, most would automatically assume huge numbers are in the offing, but with Arian Foster, who returned to practice Wednesday, expected back, Gary Kubiak will likely install a run-heavy attack to get his prized rusher going. It's also important to note Smith is one of the rare DBs who possesses the size and speed to hang with Andre Johnson. If he can prevent the All-Pro from chewing up large chunks downfield, Schaub may again post vanilla numbers."

S"Last week, Mike Munchak, given the keys to a Ferrari, decided to the leave the cherished ride under cover as Johnson touched the rock just 15 times against Jacksonville, compiling 49 yards. Smooth move, Cameron Frye. The first-year head coach has vowed No. 28 will be deployed more often in the follow-up, but owners with viable alternatives may want to leave the $50 million vehicle in park. The Ravens dominated the line of scrimmage last week against Pittsburgh. Rashard Mendenhall, swarmed under repeatedly by a sea of black, finished with just 45 yards on 12 carries. Without an explosive passing attack a similar scenario could unfold for Captain Quick. Keep in mind, he's struggled in the past against stiff defenses. Last year versus the aforementioned Steelers, Eagles and Chargers \xe2\x80\x94 each ranked inside the top-15 in run D \xe2\x80\x94 he averaged just 69.7 total yards per game and 3.8 yards per carry. Also note Baltimore has only surrendered three 100-yard RB games in its past 25 regular season contests. Better days are ahead, but with rust still visible, Johnson is one stud who could again step on a landmine."

S'To many, designating the JC of KC a "Lame" is enough to incite a holy war. However, the Noise, armed with killer bunnies and cow catapults, is more than prepared to fend off an army of Charles crusaders. Without question, the KC rusher is one of the league\'s most versatile and explosive backs. His 6.4 yards per carry average last year was the second-best all-time. But with Dexter McCluster and Thomas Jones cutting into his workload and facing the daunting task of coming nose-to-nose with man-eaters Corey Williams and Ndamukong Suh, his prospects of a top-level Week 2 performance are dire. More damning, the absence of defensive leader Eric Berry could keep Matthew Stafford on the field for an eternity, ruining JC\'s chances of RB1 numbers. He will still play a pivotal role in the passing game, especially if the Chiefs are buried early, but expect his totals, outside PPR leagues, to be far from divine.'

S"In the Land of 10,000 Lakes, expect this Buccaneer's boat to capsize. Last week, Williams picked up where he left off in his rookie season, hauling in four catches for 50 yards, including a beautiful toe-tapping score in the endzone late in the fourth quarter. Blessed with plus size, speed and athleticism, he's a cumbersome matchup for almost any corner. However, expect Antoine Winfield to step up to the challenge. The corner is a tenacious, hard-hitting defender who did a masterful job containing Vincent Jackson a week ago. In fact, the Vikes' Cover 2 as a whole played brilliantly, holding V-Jax and Malcom Floyd to a combined five receptions for 76 yards. Last season, Right Coast Mike failed to surpass eight points in a fantasy game only five times in 16 starts. Anticipate this week to be his first disappearing act of 2011."

S"Entering draft season, many tabbed Lloyd a one-hit wonder. But last week in slick conditions against the Raiders, the No. 1 showed he was no Kriss Kross, grabbing a game-high six passes for 89 yards. Most weeks, he will be at worst a midrange WR2, but against the Bengals, an unfavorable outcome could develop. Lloyd, sidelined by a mild groin strain, missed practice Wednesday. Currently listed as day-to-day, he is expected to suit up Sunday. However, the hinderance could prove problematic against the Bengals' surprising secondary. Last week, Leon Hall and Nate Clements limited Browns receivers to just six catches for 84 yards. Granted Lloyd is more talented than Mohamed Massaquoi, Greg Little and Josh Cribbs, but the bracketing nature of Marvin Lewis' scheme may lead to unpleasant results. Also, keep in mind due to Denver's ongoing issues against the run, Cedric Benson may eat a ton of clock, limiting the receiver's scoring opportunities. Assuming he's active, Lloyd is still a serviceable WR3 in 12-teamers, just don't bank on a stellar day."

S'Gamers, what does Carson have to do to earn your respect? Run for touchdowns? Join the Occupy Oakland movement? Out-wrestle the Ultimate Warrior for the Intercontinental Belt? It\'s criminal the "Red Baron" A) Isn\'t universally owned. He\'s still available in 60-percent of Y! leagues. B) Hasn\'t received widespread support from fanalsyts as an every-week starter. After back-to-back top-10 performances, it\'s time to shower the former Pro Bowler in adoration. For a player just four weeks removed from eating Cheetohs while reclined in his barcalounger, what he\'s accomplished with a condensed playbook is nothing short of spectacular. Yes, his six picks are a black-eye, but his progressions, delivery and exceptional play in the no-huddle have erased doubts. It\'s scary to think, as Hue Jackson remarked last week, the QB "is just getting warmed up." This week, Carson reaches the boiling point. Minnesota\'s secondary, sans Antoine Winfield, is an exposed unit. Without its leader on the field from Weeks 5-8, the Vikes surrendered 8.0 yards per attempt, 286.5 yards per game and 2.0 air strikes per game. Look for Palmer, who\'s notched 9.8 yards per attempt in three games, to take numerous shots downfield with Denarius Moore against Minnesota\'s broken Cover 2. Expect the pair to connect often. Throw in the Raiders\' vulnerabilities on defense, and Palmer is destined for QB1 numbers yet again. Enough is enough. Unless you have unbenchable alternatives, the underappreciated passer needs to be in your lineup.'

S"Quietly, over the past five weeks, the Beast has been unleashed. Lynch, running with the anger of 100 comic book villans, has declared war on would-be tacklers, racking substantial yards after contact. Against the Cowboys and Ravens, two of the NFL's unkindest run defenses, the 'Hawk scratched and clawed his way to 310 total yards and two scores, extending his TD streak to five games. The reason for his midseason emergence is largely due to an increase in aggressiveness. Earlier this year, he plodded timidly to the line, rarely netting more than three yards per carry. But, finally comfortable with Seattle's zone-blocking scheme, Lynch, as Tom Cable noted, has exercised more discipline, seeing the hole more clearly. He's also, finally, been utilized more in the pass game. Still, despite his consistent level of play, few owners have taken notice, indicative in his low start percentage. Wake up fools. The rancid Rams have shown some improvement versus the run. Two weeks ago Beanie Wells managed just 20 yards on 10 carries. But this is still an exploitable unit. Last week, Chris Ogbonnaya totaled 109 yards against it. And since Week 6, St. Louis has surrendered 5.0 yards per carry to RBs. Given his back-breaking workload and dandy matchup, it's time to feed the Beast."

S'The Football Frankenstein is ALIVE! HE\'S ALIVE!!! Since Ahmad Bradshaw was felled by a foot injury in Week 8, Jacobs, who has vowed to "play hard until they (the Giants) ax me," has run with renewed vim and vigor. Against New England and San Francisco, the league\'s unfriendliest run defense, he totaled 172 yards and a touchdown, even providing a spark in the pass game. Bradshaw hasn\'t practiced since October 28 and remains very doubtful to return against the Eagles. Assuming he sits, Jacobs should again log upwards of 20 touches. Philly, which has been spanked often between-the-tackles, is a team in complete disarray, especially defensively. On the year, the Eagles have surrendered 5.0 yards per carry, 112.4 rushing yards per game and eight scores to RBs, equal to the sixth-most points allowed. Jacobs\' powerful running style should inflict heavy damage. Recall in Week 3, the Giants, then with a healthy Bradshaw, rolled up over 100 yards on the ground against this same defense. Reanimate him.'

S"The real reason Jay Cutler dumped Kristin Cavallari: He's head-over-heels in love with Bennett. Since the receiver returned to the lineup two weeks ago, the pair have reforged a bond, connecting 11 times (on 11 targets) for 176 yards and a touchdown. Recall preseason Mike Martz prognosticated Bennett would catch upwards of 75 balls this season, a bold, but fair prediction. Historically, slot receivers in the coordinator's system have performed well. Remember Mike Furrey's 2008? The Bears wideout, like Furrey, is a fantastic route runner who routinely exploits soft spots in zone coverage. That skill combined with the trust of Cutler makes him a very attractive WR3 in Week 11 and beyond. The Chargers, reeling defensively, are in a dark place. Injuries and underperformance have unplugged the trendy preseason Super Bowl pick. In particular, the secondary, battered by injuries, has struggled mightily. Since Week 6, only the Minnesota Vikings have yielded more fantasy points to wide receivers. Without question Matt Forte is the centerpiece of the Bears offense, but don't be surprised if Earl pays a noble dividend for the third-straight week."

S"For those that have endured Williams' horrific sophomore slump, this is your theme song. Speaking as a jilted owner, the underachiever has infuriated many. Suffocated by increased double teams, he's yet to eclipse 80-yards in a game this year and hasn't scored since Week 1. Though he didn't single-out his young No. 1, Raheem Morris' scathing words that his receivers haven't competed enough for balls, particularly those thrown in the red-zone, speaks to Williams. The wideout ranks 86th in catch percentage (54.2). Yes, part of the problem is Josh Freeman's regression, but Williams, who has the third-most drops in the NFL (8), bears a great deal of responsibility. Still, despite his enormous decline, he's a commodity to lean on in Week 11. Green Bay, which has had its problems against the pass, is a terrific matchup. Eleven WRs have reached the 70-yard mark against the Pack this year. And on the season, Green Bay has allowed the third-most fantasy points to the position. If there was ever a week for Williams to snap out of his season-long coma, this is it."

S'"The Director," once a Heisman candidate while at Central Florida and a respectable RB2 in fantasy circles only three short years ago, quickly saw his career fade to black after he was let go by the Lions earlier this year. But with Jahvid Best sidelined indefinitely and Detroit\'s running game stuck in neutral, Smith auditioned for a roster spot two weeks ago. Jim Schwartz, amazed by the runner\'s mobility and overall shape at the RB\'s workout, immediately jumped on the opportunity to reacquire Smith. Last week in his first game since re-signing, he touched the rock six times (on 28 snaps) compiling 29 yards in a blowout loss at Chicago. His workload could expand in his second game. Maurice Morris has played fairly well since sliding into the starter\'s role, racking 4.8 yards per carry. But MoMo isn\'t the greatest interior runner. Overall, the junior Smith, who is still only 24-years-young, might actually be the better fit. Because Matthew Stafford is dealing with a broken finger on his throwing hand, the air-heavy Lions may follow a more conservative approach in Week 11. The matchup practically demands it. Carolina, which ranks 28th in the league versus the run, has conceded 4.9 yards per carry, 175.1 total yards per game and 13 TDs to RBs, equal to the second-most fantasy points allowed. Sure it\'s a gamble, but flexing Smith in deep leagues could make you look like a genius.'

S"No pain-free game. No Jeremy Maclin. No guarantee DeSean Jackson will wake up in time for kickoff. No thanks. The risk of playing a rib-cracked Vick against a nearly healed Giants defense is immense. Philly's offensive line, which couldn't protect its QB from a chubby preschooler earlier this year, has shown some improvement. The passer, for the most part, has had additional time in the pocket over the past couple weeks. Unfortunately, the opposite result has occurred. His rushing production remains as formidable as ever (63.7 ypg since Week 4), but downfield connections have been few and far between. Against a pair of average secondaries, Chicago and Arizona, Vick averaged a miserable 4.7 yards per attempt. Gut feeling says he'll cowboy up and play this week in a last-ditch effort to turn the Eagles' nightmare season around. However, the final tally likely won't be pretty. Recall in his first encounter with the G-Men in Week 3, he managed just 11.3 fantasy points in standard leagues (176-0-1, 31 ryds), his worst full-game performance as Philly's starter. He also was felled by a broken hand late. And, in that contest, Osi Umenyora was on the sidelines in street clothes. The rematch could be just as ugly. Collectively, the Giants, in particular Corey Webster, have executed fairly well against the pass. Only Rex Grossman and Tom Brady have thrown for at least 250 yards and two scores against them. Because of his duality, No. 7 is always a threat for statistical explosions, but given the circumstances (Injury, matchup, Maclin's likely absence) he's one to avoid even if active. The Giants will have a cure for the Vickness."

S'Mired in a season-long slump, CJ2Lame finally returned to the land of the living last week, totaling 174 total yards and a touchdown, an effort that ranked third-best among Week 10 rushers. Post-game Mike Munchak gave credit to the offensive line opening up creases for Johnson. He also applauded the back\'s much improved patience and vision. Before everyone experiences an amnesic lapse and jumps back on the bandwagon, there are a couple of ideas to keep in mind: 1) It was Carolina, the league\'s 28th-ranked run defense. A morbidly obese dachshund could waddle it\'s way to 100 yards and a touch against the Panthers. 2) This was only Johnson\'s second 100-yard rushing output in nine games.  Expect reality to set-in versus Atlanta. "Staunch" best describes the Falcons run defense. Linebacker Sean Weatherspoon leads his position in stops, many of those stands coming on the ground. According to Pro Football Focus, he, Corey Peters and Jonathan Babineaux are well-above the league average stuffing the run. Overall, the Falcons have held RBs to just 3.8 yards per carry. Matt Forte and LeSean McCoy are the only two rushers to surpass the century mark in total yardage against them this season. It\'s been a long, frustrating road for Johnson supporters. Sadly, though, his triumphant return to the top-five may have only been brief.'

S"Mathews' season, unsurprisingly, has taken more twists and runs than the Colossus at Magic Mountain. For the most part, when healthy, he's performed like a legitimate RB1. Only a nasty case of fumbilitis Halloween night in Kansas City raised concern. Even last week, operating at about 75-percent capacity, he looked good, showing considerable explosion on the edge. Mathews, expected to put in a full week's worth of practices, is functioning at full-strength for the first time in weeks. However, a date with the Monsters of the Midway awaits. The Bears bared their claws last week, dismantling Matthew Stafford and the Lions. Mixing up blitz schemes and even occasionally abandoning the Cover 2, Brian Urlacher and company socked Jim Schwartz's team in the mouth. If that attitude carries over into Week 11, it could be a long 60 minutes for the Bolts, especially given their injuries on the O-line. On the season, Chicago has yielded 5.2 yards per carry to RBs. But since Week 6, its allowed just 3.7 yards per carry and 77.5 total yards per game to RBs, including a mere 40 yards to Adrian Peterson. Considering the matchup, Mathews' expected split workload with Mike Tolbert and his knack for injuries, he's an enhanced risk as an RB2 in 12-teamers."

S'When translated in Fantasy, "Palko" means "schmo." Seriously, his headshot says it all. Since entering the league three years ago, Larry Fitzgerald\'s former college roommate at Pitt has lived a vagabond existence, logging stints with New Orleans, Pittsburgh, the mighty Montreal Alouettes (CFL) and now Kansas City. Though Palko has proven effective in a spread system predicated on short slants and hooks, his below average arm strength and questionable second/third reads leave a lot to be desired. The drop-off from Matt Cassel is akin to when Van Halen hired that pansy who sung "More than Words" to replace Sammy Hagar/David Lee Roth. Sure, it\'s possible he could surprise, but Bill Belichick, despite his team\'s problems against the pass, is bound to bewilder and confuse the inexperienced quarterback. Not to mention, Bowe\'s likely shadow, Kyle Arrington, who\'s played extremely well as a starter, isn\'t a slouch in coverage. QBs have completed just 44.7-percent of their passes to the corner\'s side. Bowe is a supreme talent with a great paper matchup, but the unknown doesn\'t make him a slam dunk WR1. Exercise caution.'

S'Routinely lost in the shuffle, the popular early-round pick simply hasn\'t been himself this season. To explain hi sharp decline, analysts have tossed out theories ranging from a hidden injury to the impact of Julio Jones. But, according to the not-so-Hot Roddy, "dropped balls" and a collective lack of "chemistry" on offense are to blame, a true bunch of Mularkey. Both assessments are accurate. White has one less botched pass through nine games than he did in 16 last year. And Mularkey has indeed struggled in the play-calling department. With the weapons Atlanta has, its an offense, which ranks 16th in the league in points per game, that should be in the upper-echelon alongside scoring giants Green Bay, New Orleans and New England. White, matched against Cortland Finnegan fresh off limiting Carolina\'s Steve Smith to just five catches for 33 yards, isn\'t likely to suddenly rebound. The CB\'s assignments have netted just 9.5 yards per catch and 32.8 yards per game against him. Overall, Mike Wallace, Hines Ward and Jerome Simpson are the only WRs to tally double-digit points versus Tennessee all year. White may be the presence of all colors, but in fantasy it\'s devoid of points.'

S"What a difference a year makes. At this point on the fantasy calendar last year, people were sacrificing limbs for Orton's services. Thriving in Josh McDaniels' pass-first system, the Ryan Fitzpatrick of 2010 was coming off a 476-yard spanking of the Colts. But this year, under the conservative direction of John Fox, The Neckbeard hasn't exactly smothered the competition in hair grease. His yards per attempt, an outstanding 7.3 last year, has plummeted to 6.1 this year. As a result, his overall production has turned south, evident in his 18.2 points per game output, the 23rd-best mark among QBs in virtual pigskin. However, there's hope for a flashback this week against Green Bay. The Packers, one of the league's best in handcuffing QBs last year, are one of the worst this season. Signal callers are averaging a ridiculous 8.7 yards per attempt, 384.3 passing yards and two touchdowns per game against them. With or without Tramon Williams, the secondary hasn't exactly delivered flavorful results. In a contest in which the Broncos will likely fall behind early, Orton could easily eclipse 40 attempts, and accumulate plenty of garbage points, en route to a strong QB1 effort."

S'Foster\'s maddening hamstring issue has driven the Noise to the bottle. My liver dwarfs Snooki\'s. But this week no long Wild Turkey consultations will be needed. Foster is poised for a major breakout. On Gary Kubiak\'s Monday radio show, the coach predicted the rush king will be "full-speed, ready to go" against visiting Pittsburgh. If he puts in an entire week\'s worth of practice, he should not only play, but start and carry most of the load. Ben Tate, who\'s averaged 4.6 yards per carry and 100.3 rushing yards per game, was terrific in his absence, but the Texans miss Foster\'s all-around efficiency, particularly in the red zone. As the Chronicle\'s Richard Justice recently noted, on 26 carries inside the 20 Houston backs have logged 1-yard or less 11 times. Last season, Foster scored 14 times on 56 red-zone touches, a success rate of 25-percent. On the surface, a matchup with Pittsburgh looks very unappealing. But the Steelers have been battered between the tackles, noted in their 4.6 yards per carry allowed to RBs. When Joseph Addai is shedding tackles and finding the end-zone that\'s usually a bad sign. Because the Texans are a balanced offensive team, boast a premier O-line and are at home, Foster should thrive. Yes, Tate will supplant him on a series or two, but for the popular No. 1 pick, this is his week to finally live up to preseason expectations. (UPDATE: Kubiak said Wednesday Foster need to be brought along "the right way." It appears he could be eased back into the lead role this week, possibly totaling around 14-17 touches. As a result, I\'ve adjusted my projection below.)'

S"So far this season, the Pocket Rocket's value has soared to the moon. Despite only 36 total touches, the lowest amount of any back currently ranked in the top-15, he's averaged a potent 10.6 points per game in standard formats. With 21 catches through three games, he's been even more indispensable in PPR settings. Interestingly, he's seen the most snaps of any Saints rusher, totaling 97 plays compared to 72 for Pierre Thomas and 61 for Mark Ingram. This week, another stellar effort is on tap. Jacksonville's run defense, one of the friendliest in the league last year, has stiffened significantly in 2011. The addition of linebackers Clint Sessions and Paul Posluszny has done wonders. Overall, the Jags have yielded 3.0 yards per carry and the second-fewest fantasy points to RBs. But Sproles isn't your everyday up-the-gut back. His strength resides in exploiting matchups on the peripheries, an area where the Jags have performed marginally. Don't expect spectacular totals, but numbers close to what he achieved Week 1 at Green Bay are certainly possible. Activate him in PPR formats big or small."

S"Moore, pimped heavily by yours truly preseason (Note: I was a wee bit off on Cam Newton), is following the Mike Williams (TB) formula for first-year success. Catchless in Week 1, the fifth-rounder from Tennessee has since stepped to the forefront compiling nine receptions for 189 yards and a touchdown in his past two games. Last week against the suddenly flightless Jets, he also chipped in 23 rushing yards and a ground score. The rookie will never be the fastest or strongest player on the field, but he's a savvy route-runner with plus quickness and above average cutting and leaping ability. Without much competition for targets, he has become the apple of Jason Campbell's eye. This week, the duo will be inseparable. New England is a disaster defensively, especially versus the pass. Already this season the Pats have given up 23 pass plays of 20-plus yards, the most in the league. Expect Moore to be a thorn in the side of terribly average corners Devin McCourty and Ras-I Dowling. Earlier this week Hue Jackson expressed his desire to give No. 17 the ball more. Week 4 presents the perfect opportunity. Consider him a strong WR2 in 12-team formats."

S'Usually, anyone associated with the Tarvarisaurus is hazardous to one\'s fantasy health. But because of the passer\'s man-love for Rice, he\'s actually quite helpful. Last week, in the wideout\'s return to the starting lineup, the former Vikings plundered arguably the worst secondary in the NFC (Arizona) connecting eight times for 109 yards. "Comfortable" with one another after spending four seasons together in Minnesota, the tandem\'s rekindled bromance should carry over this week against Atlanta. For the most part, Brent Grimes has performed well this season, checking in as the 22nd-most valuable corner in the league thus far according to Pro Football Focus. However, the Falcons secondary as a whole has been relatively mediocre. Opposing QBs have averaged a healthy 8.0 yards per attempt and completed 12 passes for 20 or more yards against it. Rice, who has a six-inch height advantage over Grimes, will be fed early and often. Seattle is typically a wasteland of fantasy production, but this week, the Uncle Ben\'s of fantasy receivers is a tasty side worth scooping onto your plate.'

S'Believe it or not, Ridley is the New England back to own not only this week, but possibly beyond. BenJarvus Green-Ellis and Danny Woodhead haven\'t inspired much hope for the Pats run game. The underachieving pair have averaged a combined 3.9 yards per carry. Coming off his best performance of the young season (7-44, 1-8 at Buf), Ridley could see double-digit touches for the first time this year. Monday New England personnel director Nick Caserio said the rookie "made the most of the opportunity," but offensive coordinator Bill O\'Brien stressed he still has "a long way to go." Regardless, the unbalanced Pats must establish a ground game to keep an overworked, and generally porous, defense on the sidelines. Tom Brady alone can\'t carry this team to a division title. Ridley could be the solution. At 5-foot-11, 225 pounds, the LSU product is a tough interior runner with above average versatility, a skill set which could prove problematic for the Raiders. Oakland has surrendered 5.8 yards per carry, 196 total yards and four touchdowns -- equal to the third-most fantasy points allowed -- to RBs this season. In a game where ball control will likely be emphasized, look for The Riddler to leave the Raiders bewildered'

S"In Romo's gutsy performance against the 'Skins last Monday night, he and his receivers were often incommunicado. In what at times seemed like a backyard football game, the passer was often forced to play traffic cop, directing his receivers toward soft spots in Washington coverage. Sometimes his tutelage sunk in. Most of the time it didn't. For a frustrated Romo, Miles Austin couldn't return to the field fast enough. Communication issues could again arise this week against a ball-hawking Detroit club. The unblemished Lions have surrendered just 5.8 yards per attempt, 202.7 passing yards per game and two air scores to QBs, equal to the fourth-fewest fantasy points allowed. Romo is a master of improvisation, but bull-rushers Ndamukong Suh, Corey Williams and rookie Nick Fairley, who might be in uniform for the first time this season, will likely breathe down his neck all afternoon. His high-tech Kevlar vest may be able to deflect little Johnny's tee-ball bat, but Suh is an entirely different story. Unless he quickly gets on the same page with his receivers and the Cowboys offensive line plays the game of its life, it could be another uneventful fantasy week for the three-time Pro Bowler."

S'When CJ2K was snared in the late first-round in eleventh hour drafts his investors likely pumped their fists in excitement. However, since then, many of those same owners have stared at their computer screens in disbelief, as Johnson has racked a number of 1-yard gut-punches. Currently the 35th-best back in fantasy, four spots behind future HOFer Michael Bush, Johnson has seriously bombed. After last week\'s unencouraging 75 total yard effort against the Broncos, Captain Quick vowed he would "fix" things. Many analysts, including Y!\'s own Eddie George, are buying into it. The Noise still has his doubts. Sure, he\'s still rounding into form after a prolonged layoff, but the Titans\' run-blocking execution has been horrific, evident in Johnson\'s 2.1 yards per carry this season. Only intensifying matters is the loss of Kenny Britt. CJ2K, already the center of defensive coordinators\' game-plans, will garner even more attention. Unless inconsistent tight end Jared Cook can step up and stretch the field, more woeful outings are in store for the rusher. Cleveland, which has allowed 162.3 total yards per game to RBs this season, is an exploitable defense, but until improvements in several areas are made a return to normalcy will remain in the distance. Be leery.'

S"Similar to last year, Best is off to a scorching start. Through three weeks he's averaged 14.8 points per game in standard formats, good enough for a Round 1 value (No. 8 among RBs) in 10-team leagues. Fifth in receptions with 15, he's been even more valuable in PPR-friendly formats. However, his matchup against a stingy Dallas front poses many problems. On the season, opposing rushers have performed 22.8% below the league average against the 'Boys, netting just 2.7 yards per carry. Plungers DeMarcus Ware, the No. 1 run enforcer in the league according to Pro Football Focus, and Jay Ratliff have done a tremendous job executing on gap assignments. Washington had some success passing the ball to Tim Hightower and Roy Helu on the wings last week. Ultimately, if Best hopes to deliver top-20 numbers he will have to inflict similar damage in space. Because he'll likely reel in 4-5 receptions, he's tough to bench in PPR formats. But in standard leagues, anticipate a final line similar to last week's 24th-best output posted against Minnesota."

S"Nancy Grace in fluorescent Spandex. That's how hideous Williams' numbers have been over the past two weeks. Currently, the consistency king wears a tarnished crown. A year ago Right Coast Mike crossed the chalk in 10 of 17 contests. So far this year, the second-year receiver, who's admittedly crumbled under increased defensive attention, has found the end-zone just once and has yet to surpass 55 yards in a game. The downward trend likely won't get bucked against Indy. For all the troubles the Colts have experienced on offense, defensively they've played admirably. Dwight Freeney and Robert Mathis have routinely harassed quarterbacks, altering passes and creating miscues. With that in mind look for Raheem Morris to install a conservative game-plan centered on the legs of LeGarrette Blount. Indy's interior defense, though much improved, is still vulnerable. Even when Freeman turns to the air, don't expect No. 19 to be his weapon of choice. Cover 2 schemes, like what Indy deploys, have wreaked havoc on the youngster. Two weeks ago in Minnesota he was limited to just one catch for -4-yards, a victim of added pressure over the top. If the Colts follow a similar strategy, Williams could again suffer."

S"The speedy Henderson is exactly what the doctor ordered for a Saints club who lost its most reliable target, Marques Colston, to a broken collarbone in Green Bay Week 1. Once an object of inconsistency, he's delivered steady results netting 88.3 yards per game with three scores in three games, an excellent line for a player largely undrafted in 12-team formats. Unfortunately, all good things come to an end. With Lance Moore now healthy, Henderson, who finished with just three catches for 62 yards last week, will likely return to his hit-or-miss ways. Against Houston he attracted just four targets compared to 12 in his previous two efforts. Colston's shocking early activation only complicate matters. Expect another light workload this week. A season ago, Jacksonville was arguably the worst secondary in the NFL giving up 8.3 yards per attempt. However, this year, the retooled defense has done a complete 180, limiting opposing passers to a very respectable 6.6 yards per attempt. As a result, receivers are performing 28.2% below the league average against the Jags. Yes, in a high-yield passing offense Henderson will get a few looks, but your sell-high window is about to close."

S"Expectations for Ryan entering his fourth year were ridiculously high. Many believed the addition of Julio Jones to an already impressive stable of weapons would springboard his numbers to stratospheric heights. But averaging 19.7 points per game, the 14th-best output among QBs, he's failed to make that giant leap. What's to blame? Under more duress than last year (times sacked in '10: 23, '11: 14), he's wilted under the rising heat, evident in his completion%age drop-off and spike in interceptions. Though the Panthers have allowed a league-high 8.7 yards per attempt, don't bank on Ryan suddenly doing an about face. Julio, handicapped by a strained hamstring, will be in street clothes. And with Chris Gamble, one of the league's finest cover corners according to Pro Football Focus, back in action, the paper friendly matchup is a bit deceiving. To alleviate pressure on Ryan and considering Carolina's problems against the run (5.3 ypc to RBs), Mike Smith will likely lean heavily on Michael Turner, a strategy the head coach has wanted to revert to for weeks. The Falcons' pass-run split currently stands at 56-44. Unless Cam Newton buries Atlanta early, don't expect the gunslinger to come out firing."

S'Mitt Romney is the most charismatic, relatable Republican candidate to come along in years. Generic cereals are just as good as original brands. And Radiohead hasn\'t turned weird, it\'s simply discovered its brilliantly imaginative side (Sidebar: I really miss The Bends days). To some, these are statements on par with calling the Purple Jesus a lame. Though he\'s notched two spectacular 25-point-plus efforts this year, not all has been roses for All-Day. Last year, he didn\'t post his first sub-10-point effort until Week 10. Already twice this year he\'s failed to reach double-digits (Clarification: In standard, non-fractional leagues). His Sunday night battle with the Bears could mark his third. In recent years, the Midway Monsters have had Peterson\'s number, holding the four-time Pro Bowler just under 3.5 yards per carry in their past three meetings. Yes, the Bears, still licking their wounds after giving up 163 yards on the ground to Jahvid Best Monday night, are vulnerable up front. Best, Turner and DeAngelo Williams each ripped off big runs against them. But Minnesota, unlike Chicago\'s previous opponents, has little to no passing game, meaning Brian Urlacher and company will focus their attention almost exclusively on stopping No. 28. The last time Peterson traveled to Chicago, he was held to a mere 75 total yards on 21 touches. In the rematch, another deflating effort could be in the offing. (UPDATE: Now that two starters on the Bears\' defensive line are expected to miss Sunday night\'s game and with the safeties completely shuffled, my Peterson "Lame" designation is beyond insane. Due to the news, I\'ve moved him up significantly in my ranks. However, since my prediction was written in stone Wednesday, I\'ll score it as though nothing changed.)'

S'Soaring peaks and depressing valleys best summarize Best\'s season thus far. The wildly inconsistent rusher has surpassed the 20-point mark and undercut the 10-point line twice in five games. In other words, he\'s the definition of "matchup-only" play. Coming off his finest rushing performance of his young career, the second-year standout should crash back to earth. San Francisco has deflected every back that\'s attempted to puncture its defensive line. Patrick Willis and friends have routinely snuffed out the run, shooting gaps aggressively and vigorously. The Niners have yet to allow a 70-yard rusher this season, holding starting RBs to just 2.8 yards per carry and 51.6 total yards per game. In a bye-heavy week, Best is still employable for PPR owners with shaky alternatives. But in standard formats, even highly competitive ones, he\'s barely flexy sexy. Avoid this Lion\'s den.'

S"Is Painter-to-Garcon the new Manning-to-Harrison? Well, not exactly. Yes, Curtis Painter and Garcon have fostered bromantic feelings for one another over the past two weeks combining for four receptions (16 targets), 271 yards and four touchdowns, but those gaudy totals were achieved against Tampa Bay and Kansas City, two defenses that rank No. 20 and No. 17, respectively, against the pass. Versus Cincinnati, the league's third-stingiest pass D, Garcon will be force fed a strong dose of reality. Bengals corner Leon Hall has exhibited above average play thus far, but the true strength of Cincy's bracketing defense lies in its safeties. According to Pro Football Focus, Reggie Nelson and Chris Crocker rank well-inside the position's top-20 in pass coverage. That extra help over-the-top should come in handy containing the speedy Garcon downfield. Only two wideouts, Eric Decker and Jason Hill, have scored at least eight fantasy points against the Queen City Kitties this year. Garcon won't be the third."

S'Revis Island is a lonely, barren place populated by palm trees, friendly volleyballs and empty fantasy performances. Expect Marshall to take-up a one-week residency. The offensive situation in Miami is becoming increasingly dire. All too familiar to \'Fins fans, drives have routinely bogged down under new offensive coordinator Brian Daboll. The Dolphins, thanks in part to Marshall\'s butter-fingers, rank 26th in red-zone efficiency. Establishing a consistent ground game would certainly help remedy those problems. With Matt Moore now under center and Daniel Thomas expected back in the lineup, that blueprint could unfold this week in New York, especially considering the inadequacies of the Jets\' defensive line. If proven true, Marshall is destined for disappointment. Yes, the receiver\'s history versus NY is quite encouraging (17-237-2 in three games). However, top targets have performed neutrally against the Jets this year averaging 3.6 receptions and 61 yards per game. Unless Moore, who was outplayed by Jimmy "I couldn\'t hit the Atlantic Ocean from 10-yards away" Clausen last year in Carolina, suddenly morphs into Steve Beuerlein \'99, Marshall will be marooned.'

S'Though the Texans two-stepped all over Tennessee last week, owners should still throw the Titans\' Dr. Evil a "frickin\' bone." The Colts, whose anuses were displaced by New Orleans on Sunday night, are epically bad in every way, shape and form defensively. The club\'s highest ranking defender against the pass is Antoine Bethea, who checks in at 54th in coverage according to Pro Football Focus. On the season, Indy has surrendered a generous 8.5 yards per attempt, 275.5 passing yards and 2.0 passing touchdowns per game, equal to the seventh-most fantasy points allowed to QBs. In fact, a signal caller has reached the 23-point threshold in four of the Colts\' past five games. Before Week 7, Hasselbeck had been one of the game\'s biggest surprises. So valuable to the franchise, particularly with Chris Johnson running into brick walls, MVP whispers surfaced in and around Nashville. Though deeming Hasselbeck most valuable is akin to nominating Todd "Hobo" Haley Fashionista of the Millennium, he is very capable of emulating Tom Brady, minus the golden locks, this week. Expect him to compile his fourth multi-TD effort in seven starts. All Titans, even CJ2K, could post banner numbers in Week 8.'

S'Spandau Ballet\'s "True." That\'s what plays in the Noise\'s head whenever daydreaming about the PT Bruiser. Yes, his fantasy glory days of 2008 are well behind him, but Thomas, though used in a much more limited role, is still a highly efficient, versatile back. On roughly 10 grips per game, he\'s averaged 6.0 yards per touch. In last week\'s Bloodbath on the Bayou, PT showcased vintage form collecting a game-high 125 total yards on a season-best 15 touches. With Mark Ingram\'s Week 8 availability clouded by a bruised heel and Christopher Ivory close, but not necessarily ready, to return to game action, the forgotten backup could earn a workload increase against the softest run defense in the NFC, St. Louis. The rancid Rams, coming off a 253-yard thrashing by rookie DeMarco Murray, have surrendered 5.9 yards per carry, 200 total yards per game and six total touchdowns to RBs on the year, equal to the second-most fantasy points allowed. Most importantly for the Saint, they\'ve also struggled defending backs in the flat. LeSean McCoy, Ray Rice and Ahmad Bradshaw all compiled sizable numbers in the passing game against them. In what should be a very one-sided matchup, PT should roll. If Ingram rides the pine and Ivory is held back, count on him as an RB2 in 12-team and deeper formats.'

S"Over the past 72 hours, incensed Arcadians, who've read glowing recommendations about Torain in this space over the past couple weeks, have erected a gallows in Fantasyland. To the spurned, The Noise deserves to pay the ultimate price. Look, getting inside the mind of Lucifer Shanahan is a frightening exercise. Imagine a demonic, cackling Ronald McDonald in a low-lit room romping with a bondaged Grimace and you'll get the picture. Again, the man is the epitome of fantasy evil. However, with Tim Hightower permanently out of the picture and Roy Helu \xe2\x80\x94 we think \xe2\x80\x94 cemented in a third/passing-down role, Torain should finally see a hefty amount of early-down carries. Assuming he, and not the football ghost of Olandis Gary, racks 15-18 attempts, he should post handsome totals. Buffalo has given up 4.8 yards per carry, 148.2 total yards per game and eight touchdowns to rushers on the year, equal to the sixth-most fantasy points allowed. Admittedly, it's risky to count on Torain. If Washington falls behind early Helu will see most of the action. But, for the sake of my neck, the third time will be the charm. And, yes, I'm completely insane in the membrane."

S"The Ravens' offensive performance Monday night in Jacksonville was nothing short of appalling. Joe Flacco's yards per attempt matched the Noise's I.Q. (3.6). But Baltimore's pass game should jumpstart this week against Arizona. Rookie corners A.J. Jefferson and Patrick Peterson one day won't be taken lightly, but the tandem has certainly taken its fair share of lumps through the season's first half, especially last week versus Pittsburgh. Steelers receivers averaged a combined 16.5 yards per catch against them. Burned repeatedly downfield, 'Zona has allowed the third-most 20-yard pass plays and third-most fantasy points to wideouts. Smith, one of the league's fastest receivers, should have little difficulty duplicating the success Mike Wallace and Antonio Brown had in the desert. The youngster hasn't splashed six since the first quarter of his Week 3 clobbering of St. Louis, but this is his week to once again reenter the WR top-20."

S'For much of the season, mini-Mario has been on display in New York. Hampered by a concussion suffered against St. Louis Week 2 and subsequent lapses in concentration, he has yet to reach the 60-yard mark or the end-zone this year. This week, however, the wideout is bound to consume a Super Mushroom. Over the Giants\' bye, Kevin Gilbride, frustrated by Victor Cruz\'s inconsistencies, called out the upstart, remarking to the Daily News he\'s a player who "giveth and taketh away on almost a play-by-play basis." Some fans have clamored for Cruz to start opposite Hakeem Nicks, but, it\'s clear, Manningham won\'t be demoted anytime soon. Consider this your last opportunity to buy low. Miami\'s secondary, plagued by injuries and ineptitude, has performed marginally in pass coverage. No \'Fin ranks in the top-65 in coverage per Pro Football Focus. After four near-scores Week 6 against Buffalo, Manningham finally does The Dougie this week.'

S'Many expected Simpson\'s season, and possibly career, to go "Up in Smoke" after authorities raided his marijuana mansion in Kentucky a few weeks back. But the controversial wideout, who\'s not spoken publicly about the incident, has remained productive despite the distraction, logging two 100-yard efforts in six games. Maybe it\'s a motivational ploy, but Marvin Lewis has been outwardly critical of Simpson\'s on-field play, slamming him for a couple bad drops and a lack of communication with Andy Dalton two weeks ago. However, this week, the admonished receiver may finally get on his coach\'s good side. Already sans the services of Marcus Trufant, Seattle\'s secondary lost backup-turned-starter, Walter Thurmond, to a broken fibula Week 7 in Cleveland. Fifth-round pick Richard Sherman, who\'s seen just 120 snaps, is slated to fill the void. With Brandon Browner expected to shadow A.J. Green, Simpson could slap around the rookie. Deep-thinking owners with limited WR3 options, should entice the Bengal with a can of Fancy Feast \xe2\x80\xa6 or a dime sack.'

S'On Tuesday, Matthew Stafford admitted his wrenched ankle was "in a weird place" further muddying his Week 8 availability. If the former No. 1 pick is unable to suit up in Denver, Hill would be the ultimate plug \'n play passer of Week 8. The outwardly gracious Broncos have allowed a 8.1 yards per attempt, 267.2 passing yards and 1.8 passing touchdowns per game to QBs on the year. Champ Bailey\'s return has helped bolster the secondary, but he\'s little match for Calvin Johnson. And recall, Hill was no slouch filling in for Stafford last year. He netted 20.7 fantasy points per game in 10 starts. If he\'s pressed into action, a final line in range of 260-280 yards and 2-3 touchdowns is very achievable. Without Jahvid Best and considering how well the Broncos have defended the run, the Lions will likely pass early and often. Keep close tabs on this developing story.'

S"It's taken many denizens of Fantasyland seven weeks, one-half of the fantasy regular season, to realize the Jaguars defense is legit. Monday's declawing of the Ravens affirmed it. Disguising blitzes, shooting gaps and harassing receivers downfield, the Jags played masterful, all-around defense in the stunning upset. A road matchup against a Texans team coming off a 34-point drubbing of Tennessee presents a daunting task, but expect Jack Del Rio's crew to take the bull by the horns. Outside Rashean Mathis, every member of the Jacksonville secondary has blanketed receivers like tweens on Bieber. William Middleton, Derek Cox, Dawan Landry and Dwight Lowery each rank inside the top-30 in coverage according to Pro Football Focus. Unsurprisingly, the group has allowed just one multi-TD passer in their last five games, containing the likes of Cam Newton, Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger. Overall, opposing passers are averaging a measly 6.3 yards per attempt against them. Schaub has played remarkably well without Andre Johnson, eclipsing 22 fantasy points in two of his past three games. However, even with his top target potentially back, bank on the signal caller slumbering through Sunday."

S'Many will question the Noise\'s sobriety for tabbing a running back, fresh off the bye facing a defeated Miami team a "lame," but Bradshaw has reasonable odds of failing. Bend don\'t break has been the tagline of the Dolphins run defense this season. Despite yielding 148 total yards per game to backs, the unit has allowed only two rushing touchdowns. Cameron Wake and friends have also limited RBs to a mediocre 4.1 yards per carry. Prior to his TD hat-trick Week 6 against Buffalo, Bradshaw had logged a number of hollow performances, averaging just 3.5 yards per carry. Giants running back coach Jerald Ingram noted recently, the rusher\'s impatience is the leading cause for his rather unexciting per rush output. Because of his overt aggressiveness, Miami\'s respectable run defense and with Brandon Jacobs likely back, Bradshaw could bust in Week 8.'

S"Apparently, the Oompah Loompah secretes butter from his hands naturally. Sure that phenomenon may help in the candy-making process, but it's certainly a burden when it comes to toting a football. Though he lost just one fumble last week against the Ravens, MJD coughed it up three times, doubling his total in that category. His six fumbles this season are two more than he compiled in 30 games from 2009-2010. Yes, he's a sure-fire bet for 80-100 total yards every week. The man's floor is higher than most. But his ceiling is limited. Despite giving up 4.7 yards per carry to RBs this year, the Texans have stonewalled many marquee backs, including Rashard Mendenhall, Darren McFadden and Chris Johnson. Only Ray Rice and Daniel Thomas have broken the 90 total-yard mark against them. Unless Blaine Gabbert suddenly morphs into Mark Brunell '96, MJD is destined for another boring line. His turnover downside only enhance his lame chances."

S'Fitzgerald backers must feel like Linus in "The Great Pumpkin." Every week they expect the five-time Pro Bowler to rise up, convinced he will bear toys and statistical gifts. But every week they are dealt a whole lot of nothing. Sally, too, feels Fitz is a blockhead. It wasn\'t supposed to be this way. After a year in which he earned a Purple Heart for posting solid numbers despite a string of horrors at quarterback, Fitz was bound to benefit from the acquisition of Kevin Kolb. But the passer, under constant duress, has taken few shots downfield this season, limiting Fitz\'s chances for banner fantasy totals. Not having a true "Goose" has also stymied his production. As the vexed receiver told the Arizona Republic recently, he yearns for the days when wingmen Steve Breaston and Anquan Boldin helped ease coverage off him. Without a touchdown since Week 3 and only two 80-plus yard games on the season, Fitz\'s frustration is understandable. That feeling likely won\'t go away in Week 8. Assuming Lardarius Webb draws No. 11, it could be rough day. Webb\'s assignments have averaged just 10.9 yards per catch this year. Include the intense pressure Kolb will likely be under, particularly minus Beanie Wells, and it\'s clear, Fitz will be more WR2/3 than WR1 material.'

S"For owners banking on top-flight numbers from Dallas' rising star, a Dezaster awaits in Philly. Aided by the return of Miles Austin, Bryant has played exceptionally well of late, catching nine passes for 168 yards and a touchdown over the past two weeks against soft opponents New England and St. Louis. Communication issues with Tony Romo experienced during Austin's absence are no longer a problem. However, a matchup with Philly's vaunted secondary could be. Given his plus size, athleticism and combative nature \xe2\x80\x94 he ranks seventh in yards after catch (7.7) among WRs that have seen at least 200 snaps \xe2\x80\x94 Dez is quite the handful. But Asante Samuel and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie have done a better than average job in coverage this season, holding No. 2s to just 55.0 yards per game. Because of the Eagles' shortcomings in run defense, Dallas' second-coming of Herschel Walker, DeMarco Murray, could be the point of emphasis this week. It's rare Dez completely disappears, but based on the circumstances, a subpar effort is likely in the offing."

S"Raise a pint of Guinness, gamers. Based on his early season performance, the grossly underappreciated Fitzpatrick deserves a toast. Currently the sixth-best quarterback in Fantasyland, the Wonderlic wunderkind \xe2\x80\x94 his 48 out of 50 score in 2005 was slightly better than Vince Young's six the following year \xe2\x80\x94 carved up the Chiefs and Raiders totaling 472 yards and seven touchdowns while chipping in an additional 26 rushing yards. The impressive trend should continue this week against New England. Exposed by Chad Henne and Philip Rivers, the Pats secondary, giving up 8.9 per attempt, is once again Bill Belichick's achilles heel. Corner Devin McCourty has especially been brutalized. To take advantage of David Nelson's 6-foot-5 frame and Stevie Johnson's shiftiness, look for Chan Gailey to spread the field in an attempt to draw one-on-one matchups against the troubled DB. More importantly for Fitz's fantasy prospects, the Bills will likely play from behind. Buffalo allowed a whopping 323 yards to Jason Campbell last week, which suggests Tom Brady has strong odds of throwing for at least two Newtons by halftime. In what could be a lopsided affair, Fitzpatrick will be a pot 'o points at the end of the rainbow."

S'Words cannot express the torment the Noise has experienced dealing with Arian Foster and his sensitive hamstring. Crushed Rolling Rock cans litter my office. Gray hairs have become more visible. And the \'uplifting\' Smiths tune "How Soon is Now?" has played nonstop on my iPod. In a desperate attempt to help ease the pain, I went to a club. Stood on my own. Left on my own. Went home. Cried. Felt like I wanted to die. Nothing has helped. \xe2\x80\xa6 With the reigning rushing king temporarily in the rearview mirror, Tate, as Gary Kubiak discussed Monday, is expected to tote "most of the load" over the foreseeable future. The Auburn product deserves it. Over the first two weeks, he\'s averaged a potent 4.7 yards per carry, racking the fifth-most yards after contact among qualifying rushers in the league. His plowing style and overlooked versatility will prove problematic for the Saints. The acquisition of Shaun Rodgers has done little to improve New Orleans\' run defense. Through two weeks, the Saints have allowed 4.4 yards per carry, two touchdowns and 144.5 total yards per game. In what should be a shootout, look for Kubiak to control the clock by deploying Tate early and often. If the Houston offensive line, which has performed outstandingly thus far, can continue to dominate the line of scrimmage and pick-up Gregg Williams\' array of exotic blitzes, the second-year back should have no problem surpassing the century mark. Consider him a top-10 play in Week 3.'

S"Thomas, who attacked the hole with little zeal during the preseason, left his tap shoes in the closet running with considerable power and assertiveness last week. Against a much improved Houston defense he eclipsed the century mark. Look for him to carry that momentum into Week 3. Cleveland has looked like a pack of lazy chihuahuas against the run so far this season. Against a pair of mediocre offenses, Cincinnati and Indianapolis, the Browns have surrendered 4.5 yards per carry and 124.5 rushing yards per game to RBs. Though Reggie Bush touched the rock just seven times last week, a surprising revelation days after Tony Sparano noted the workload split between the two was going to be 70-30, Bush-Thomas. But after the rookie's breakout performance, the head coach hinted his backfield has evolved into a hot-hand situation. Because of Cleveland's struggles containing straight-forward backs, Thomas has sound odds of tilting the scale in his favor. Plug him in at the flex or RB2 slot in deeper formats."

S'Through two weeks of play, A.J. stands for "Absolute Juggernaut." The first-round pick from Georgia has not only lived up to the hype, he\'s greatly exceeded it. Practically unstoppable against the Browns and Broncos, he totaled 11 receptions for 165 yards and two touchdowns, a line good enough for a top-12 WR ranking in standard formats. The phenom and fellow rookie Andy Dalton have established quite the chemistry (nine targets per game). Green is the definition of a complete receiver. He has the size, speed and athleticism to emerge victorious in almost any battle, even when doubled. Without a doubt, he\'s the finest receiving talent to enter the league since Calvin Johnson. Expect his legend to continue to grow this week against the visiting Niners. Corners Tarell Brown and Tramaine Brock, both standing at 5-foot-10, are little match for the 6-foot-4 Green. The pair played poorly Week 1 against woeful Seattle and 10 levels below atrocious a week ago against Dallas, yielding 14 catches for 289 yards and three scores to Cowboys WRs. Expect Dalton to pick on them early and often. Green, like Cam Newton, is not only must-start material this week, but almost every week moving forward.'

S'The Charles-less Chiefs may make the Seahawks look like the 2007 Patriots, but McCluster is one KC player who won\'t be a fantasy buster. Versatile, explosive and feisty, the diminutive dual-threat could become the AFC\'s version of Darren Sproles. Unquestionably, Thomas Jones will be deployed between-the-tackles and in short-yardage situations, but because McCluster is a superior receiver he will command looks on all passing downs. Last week, Jones played 27 snaps, McCluster 33. That near 50-50 split should be expected over the remainder of the season, especially with the Chiefs\' inefficiencies on defense. On paper, the Chargers are a daunting foe. They have not allowed a rusher to eclipse 100-yards on the ground at home since Week 13 of 2008, a span of 19 games. Obviously, McCluster\'s odds of reaching the century mark exclusively on the ground are akin to the Noise outracing Chris Johnson on rocket-powered skates, but he could flirt with 80 total yards and 5-6 receptions in what will surely be a very one-sided game. Keep in mind, in his short career he has averaged a terrific 6.6 yards per touch. If you\'re in a PPR league, find a way to employ the "Psycho Killer" this week.'

S"The unexpected twists and turns over the course of a season is what makes fantasy so great. Value can crop up from the strangest of places. This week, Philadelphia could be that location. If Michael Vick is forced out of action, Kafka, the third-string QB on the Eagles' depth-chart entering the season, could be the biggest surprise sensation of Week 3. After Vick was felled by a concussion late in last week's thriller with Atlanta, the former Northwestern standout stepped in and stood out. Unfazed by the hostile crowd or pressure-packed situation, he completed seven of nine attempts for 72 yards (8.0 ypa), executing on a variety of tough throws. Kafka doesn't possess the strongest arm, but he's a highly intelligent and accurate system quarterback who is capable of exploiting defenses in the short-to-intermediate field. With a bevy of weapons around him, he may do exactly that against a wounded Giants D. New York, missing key players just above everywhere on defense, has surrendered 8.0 yards per attempt, three touchdowns and 318 yards per game to passers so far this season. It may seem like a stretch, but if Vick sits and Young's hamstring doesn't heal in time, Kafka could be quite the one-week wonder. Believe."

S"The two-time Super Bowl champ recovered from the Ravens' vicious Week 1 attack, throwing for 298 yards and a touchdown against the sorrowful Seahawks in the followup. Off that high, most would automatically assume he's must-start material at Indy. The Colts, who are neck-n-neck with the Seahawks and Chiefs in the Andrew Luck sweepstakes, are an abomination in just about every facet of the game. However, it's quite conceivable, this contest could unfold similarly to the Colts/Texans clash in Week 1. Recall in that game, Matt Schaub executed well early, but, once the Texans built an insurmountable lead, he became a victim of circumstance, finishing No. 25 among QBs that week in scoring (230-1-2). Plus, the Colts could again be without the services of LBs Gary Brackett and Ernie Sims, softening an already vulnerable run defense. Rashard Mendenhall is bound to be the centerpiece of the Steelers offense, limiting Ben's scoring opportunities. Yes, Indy has allowed an uncharacteristic 7.7 yards per attempt through the first two weeks, but, this week, look for Mike Tomlin to follow a ground-heavy approach. Sorry No. 7 zealots, Week 3 could be the end of the world as you know it."

S"It's been a war of attrition so far this season for Gore. His workload, as usual, has been burdensome, but he's slammed into an unhealthy amount of stone walls, evident in his awful 2.5 yards per carry on 42 totes. Some of his troubles can be attributed to poor blocking up front, but most of it is due to the always worthless Alex Smith, and unfortunate matchups against above average run defenses Seattle and Dallas. The latter will again be the brunt of his problems. After stuffing Peyton Hillis Week 1, the Bengals were gashed by Willis McGahee last week, allowing the mediocre veteran to tally his first 100-yard game since January 3, 2010. Despite the step back, Cincy should regain its identity from opening week action. Linebacker Rey Maualuga has shown glimpses of becoming an excellent run stopper. He and his defensive compadres have yielded just 3.6 yards per carry to RBs. Unless Smith miraculously morphs into Steve Young circa '95, Gore is destined to be orange crushed. Consider him a fringe RB2 in 12-team leagues."

S'Historically, Seattle is an environment where every visiting back hurts. And not just sometimes. Only two backs, Chris Johnson and Jamaal Charles (Brief moment of silence for the JC of KC\'s deceased fantasy value), have surpassed the century mark on the ground against the \'Hawks in their last 18 games at CenturyLink Field, a span stretching back to 2008. As expected, Wells has benefited greatly from the Cardinals\' acquisition of Kevin Kolb and preseason loss of Ryan Williams. Over his first two games he\'s run with impressive power and conviction posting consecutive 90-yard, 1-TD games. However, Red Bryant and Alan Branch are impenetrable enforcers against the run. Gore and Mendenhall combined for just 3.1 yards per carry against them in Weeks 1 and 2. This season should be a breakout campaign for Beanie. But in a hostile setting and faced with an unfavorable matchup, his "Weenie" side will likely make a cameo. Don\'t bite.'

S"Rarely does Jennings record a Lame-worthy effort. Stretching back to last season, he has scored at least nine points in standard formats in 11 of his past 13 contests. Suffice it to say, the consistency king has planted firm roots in Rockville. Chicago corners Tim Jennings and Charles Tillman definitely have a difficult assignment ahead. Still, Jennings' recent history against the hated Bears has been far from spectacular. Over his past three meetings, he's scored only once and averaged a mere three receptions for 57 yards. Yes, accounting for Jordy Nelson, Donald Driver and Jermichael Finley is a monumental task for a Bears unit that was torched last week by another spread juggernaut, New Orleans, but, every once in a great while, top targets in a socialist system tend to disappear. Last week, it was Nelson's turn (for 3.5 quarters). This week expect Jennings to pull a Houdini."

S'Talk of Jeff George, the greasiest mullet/\'stache combo in NFL history, returning to Indy may sound ridiculous, but for a team quickly losing its religion, the forty-something might be an improvement over Kerry Collins and Curtis Painter.  This week, unfortunately, Wayne will be forced to catch passes from Collins \xe2\x80\x94 that is, if the Revolutionary War hero can actually get him the ball. After it was humiliated in Week 1 by the rival Ravens, the Pittsburgh D rediscovered its mojo last week versus Seattle, sacking Tarvaris Jackson five times while holding the \'Hawks to a dismal 164 total yards. Considering the decrepit state of the Colts offense, particularly the O-line, Collins will likely be swarmed under early and often, inhibiting Wayne\'s chances for even an average day. It\'s possible the three-time Prow Bowler could accumulate a fair amount of points in garbage time, but Ike Taylor, the Steelers\' best defensive back, is talented enough to keep No. 87 under wraps. Go "Nightswimming" with Wayne, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon may devour your soul, and your chances of victory in Week 3.'

S"The Fro has dropped few funky beats thus far this season. In the midst of a minor slump, he's thrown just three touchdowns and four interceptions, two picks shy than what he tossed over 16 starts a season ago. Considering his completion%age has actually increased from last year ('10: 61.4, '11: 66.9), his spike in INTs is an interesting turn of events. Still, if not for his ability to consume yards with his legs (104 rushing yards, two rush TDs), he would be sipping umbrella drinks in many free agent pools. But after a laudable effort against the Colts in Week 4 (287-1-0, 27-1), he appears to be on the fast-track to regaining his mistake-free form. Expect his rejuvenation to continue this week in the Golden Gate City. Up front San Francisco is an impenetrable fortress. Opposing backs have averaged just 2.9 yards per carry against it. Because of the Niners' trench might, quarterbacks have feasted on their charitable secondary, netting 7.6 yards per attempt, 300.5 passing yards per game and seven touchdowns, equal to the 10th-most fantasy points allowed. Defensive coordinator Vic Fangio isn't bashful about blitzing. Similar to his game-plan against Michael Vick, he will occasionally turn up the heat against Tampa. If that happens Freeman's mobility, like Vick's, could prove problematic, enhancing the passer's prospects for a top-flight fantasy day. That combined with the Niners' inadequacies in pass defense suggest The Fro will let his soul glo by the Bay."

S"In the Andrew Luck Bowl, running backs, naturally, will dominate the action. Addai, in particular, could be in store for a standout day. Without the services of Peyton Manning, it's been a painful display of mediocrity for the Indy backfield. Only Seattle's pathetic ground game has proven more incompetent. Still, despite a No. 31 ranking among RBs, the six-year vet has performed admirably, netting 4.6 yards per carry. That's quite the achievement considering the number of stacked boxes he's seen. Yes, the offensive line is being held together by duct tape and Bubblicious, but if Curtis Painter, who seemingly couldn't splatter a canvas from two-yards away (43.9 completion%age), can stretch the field with Pierre Garcon like he did in Tampa Monday night Addai could finish well-inside the position's top-20 this week. Though the Chiefs have yielded just 3.9 yards per carry to rushers, including a masterful job of holding Adrian Peterson to 80 yards on 23 carries in Week 4, their 150 total yards per game and six touchdowns allowed on the season \xe2\x80\x94 equal to the fourth-most fantasy points to RBs \xe2\x80\x94 offers a bit of encouragement.  The Colts, standing at 0-4 for the first time since the days you attempted to download racy picks of Alicia Silverstone on a 28.8 connection (1998), may be a fantasy quagmire, but given the useful matchup and bye-heavy week, Addai is highly clickable."

S'Rex Ryan may blow more hot air than the Santa Ana winds, but his recent admission the Jets must revert to a "ground and pound" attack isn\'t bluster. Due to New York\'s frontline issues on defense, erratic passing game and overall subpar performance, it must get back to doing what it does best: ball control. That statement couldn\'t ring truer this week against the Patriots. In order to keep Tom Brady at bay, it\'s imperative for the Jets to win the time of possession battle. Vincent Wilfork is a man-eater, yes, but without linebacker Jerod Mayo, one of the team\'s best run defenders, New England is a very exploitable club in the trenches. Shonn Greene stands to benefit most, but the Pats\' underwhelming play defending the perimeter also enhances LT\'s Week 5 upside. On the year, the Fightin\' Beelzichicks have surrendered 9.8 receptions per game to RBs, the most in the league. Because LT is more of a change-of-pace back whose strength resides in the passing game, he has excellent odds of posting Darren Sproles-like totals this week. Equally enticing, if the Jets D fails to rise to the challenge containing the league\'s most potent pass offense, the future HOFer\'s chances for a profitable, RB2-level day will only increase. Activate him in all PPR formats.'

S'A.J. Green may be the best rookie receiver in fake football, but the Alabama Hammer has also been quite the useful PPR tool. Though he\'s yet to splash six, Jones has hauled in 24 catches (6.0/game) and a team-best 342 yards (85.5/game) through four weeks. His plus size, excellent route-running ability and combative nature has helped him transition to the pro game, even given the prolonged lockout, without a hitch. A bust of Charles Woodson will likely be displayed one day in Canton, but the seven-time Pro Bowler isn\'t the shutdown corner he once was. According to Pro Football Focus\' coverage metrics, he\'s currently the 51st-best CB in the league. Jones, 12 years Woodson\'s junior, will be a handful if the veteran is assigned to the rookie. If not, he should still have a field day. Wide receivers are performing 44.3% above the league average against the Pack. In a game that has "shootout" written all over it, Jones will pack plenty of fantasy ammo. Even in four-team fantasy leagues, he\'s must-start material.'

S"Two weeks ago against a Minnesota defense that often plays Cover 2, Pettigrew caught a career-high 11 passes for 112 yards. Lions head coach Jim Schwartz leaned on the big fella when the ground game went south, using him as a de facto running back. Against another Cover 2 defense, Chicago, a similar dink-n-dunk game-plan will likely be implemented. The Bears, who've allowed a staggering 14.2 fantasy points per game to TEs (6.5 receptions/game, 82 ypg and 4 TDs), have been picked apart across the middle of the field, even temporarily resuscitating the lifeless career of Jeremy Shockey a week ago. In two contests against the division rival a season ago, Pettigrew managed just six receptions for 42 yards. But in lockstep with Matthew Stafford over the past two weeks, the 6-foot-5, 265-pound behemoth should have no problem in the clubs' first clash of 2011. Simply put, the Bears are allergic to covering tight ends. Trust him as a TE1 in all formats."

S"The demise of Donovan McNabb is hard to watch. It's akin to seeing Knowshon Moreno attempt to ride a stationary bike or play football. Not pretty. McNabb may very well be on his last leg, but with his back against the wall, gut feeling says he'll rise to the occasion, especially given the matchup. Arizona has allowed 8.0 yards per attempt, ranking near the bottom of the league in the category. Rookie corner A.J. Jefferson has executed marginally in his first four pro games. According to Football Outsiders, the Cardinals rank No. 22 in the league defending No. 2 wideouts. Overall, pass catchers have performed 26.3% above the league average against 'Zona. Yes, Jenkins is terribly unexciting, but a favorable matchup can enhance the prospects of any average skilled player. He's attracted just four targets per game thus far, but for those stretched for viable alternatives, the former Buckeye is a nut worth cracking. Keep in mind two weeks ago against Detroit he reeled in nine receptions for 88 yards and he's two touchdowns already on the young season."

S"Schaub, minus a posterior tatt, will channel the managerial spirit of Andy Bernard this week. Without the services of Andre Johnson and considering the gross inefficiencies of Oakland's run defense, count on Gary Kubiak to call Arian Foster's number at least 25 times. It's even conceivable No. 23 could surpass 35 touches. With Darren McFadden also expected to tote his usual heavy workload, this is a game bound to have a Jim Brown era, throwback feel. Yes, the Raiders are beatable vertically. So far this season, the Silver and Black has surrendered 290.8 yards and 2.0 touchdowns per game to QBs, equal to the seventh-most fantasy points. But Jacoby Jones is a significant downgrade from Johnson. In 12 career starts he's averaged an uneventful 44.7 yards per game and scored just one touchdown. Kevin Walter is interesting and Owen Daniels should see a healthy dose of targets, but given the weakness of the opponent, Schaub will keep gun strapped in holster. His disappointing No. 18 ranking (per game) among QBs is bound to slip into the 20s. Hey, the Noise tried to warn you (Full disclosure: Hopefully you ignored any additional warnings, particularly Ryan Mathews, Steve Smith and Greg Jennings. Galactic fails on my part.)."

S"For those buried in a deep hole heading into last Monday's tilt with Indy, Blount's medicinal 141-total yard, 1-td exhibition certainly eased the pain. Now the 17th-best RB currently in fake football, he's not only overcome a slow start, he's dropkicked it. Despite netting 4.5 yards per carry over his past three games and, in a possible sign of the Mayan apocalypse, contributing in the pass game (two receptions for 27 yards), the battering ram could sink in Candlestick's thick mud. Linebackers Patrick Willis, Navorro Bowman and Ahmad Brooks have feasted on the flesh of running backs this year, each ranking well inside the top-20 against the run according to Pro Football Focus. On the season, the suffocating trio has surrendered just 2.9 yards per carry, 49 rushing yards per game and zero touchdowns to rushers, equal to the fewest fantasy points allowed. And it's not like they've faced the Chiefs every week. Felix Jones, Cedric Benson and LeSean McCoy combined for 3.4 yards per carry against them. Because of San Fran's problems against the pass, anticipate Raheem Morris to lean on the arm of Josh Freeman and not the legs of Blount. Pass him."

S'Once the perfect ballpark complement, the artist formerly known as "The Weenie" is no longer behind the wheel of America\'s most beloved motorized meat. The No. 1 ranked RB (on a per game basis), running with purpose and determination, is finally starting to live up to the All-Pro expectations many within the Cardinals organization believed he was capable of when drafted in Round 1 two years ago. Still, in a game of matchups, any player, no matter how hot, can cool off in an instant. With RB eater Kevin Williams back in tow, the Vikes D, which was slaughtered in the trenches over the first two games of the season, appears to be on the mend. Over its past two contests, Minnesota has yielded just 2.5 yards per carry to rushers. Yes, Arizona, in an attempt to steer away from Williams, will likely attack the edges, a place where Wells has thrived, early and often. However, expect Leslie Frazier to creep an extra defender into the box to contain the perimeter. No doubt this is Beanie\'s breakout year, but, for one week only, the Vikes will smother him in sauerkraut.'

S"Stevie has eliminated all doubts 2010 was a fluke. Currently the 10th-best receiver in fantasy, he's officially graduated from the WR2 ranks. In an explosive pass offense, he's a legit top target. However, even the game's best drop an enormous stinker from time-to-time. This could be Stevie's week. Philly's trio of fantasy death (Nnamdi Asomugha, Dominque Rodgers-Cromartie and Asante Samuel) hasn't exactly lived up to its advanced billing. Roddy White, Victor Cruz and, of all random people, Josh Morgan each posted quality fantasy numbers against it. Still, the threesome has performed well compared to most secondaries in the league holding wide receivers 17.1% below the league average in overall fantasy production. In a must-win situation, expect the Eagles secondary to play its best game of the season. Johnson, coming off a very vanilla 4-58-0 effort in Cincinnati, posts his second-straight flavorless game."

S'As a tight end, anytime your head coach insists a "ground and pound" philosophy must be re-instituted that generally means one thing: stay in the box. If Rex Ryan\'s conservative side truly resurfaces against New England, Keller is destined to make little noise, despite what appears to be an incredible paper matchup. After all, the very exploitable Pats have yielded 9.0 passing yards per attempt and 376.8 passing yards per game this season. Keller, who is in the midst of a breakthrough campaign (Pace: 72-1,044-8), has the appearance of a 5-75-1 slam dunk. But, outside last week\'s 4-78-0 line allowed to Oakland\'s Kevin Boss, the Pats have done a stellar job hindering tight ends. Plus-sized targets are performing 27.4% below the league average against them. That combined with Keller\'s more run-block intensive role suggests a quiet afternoon could be in store. Ground him in shallow leagues.'

S"Young's return to the starting lineup in nearly a year was at times rocky, other times spectacular. Admittedly jittery at the onset, he misjudged schemes, under-threw receivers and nailed Giants' jerseys square in the numbers. But once he found a groove and felt comfortable, vintage Vince resurfaced. In Tim Tebow fashion, he orchestrated a demoralizing 8-plus minute fourth-quarter drive, capped by an 8-yard TD strike to Riley Cooper, which sent Eli Manning and cohorts back to the locker-room with mopey faces. Overall, his 258-2-3 line was quite useful. This week, with Michael Vick still a major question mark, he could elevate his game against the league's second-friendliest pass defense. New England's secondary is tattered and torn. Injuries and ineffectiveness have battered the unit throughout the season. So desperate for fresh bodies, Bill Belichick deployed special teamer/WR Julian Edelman in a couple defensive packages Monday night. Even at full-strength quarterbacks have feasted on the Pats. Seven QBs have thrown for at least 250 yards and two touchdowns against them in 10 games. Sure, you wouldn't want the clicker in Mr. Wonderlic's hand in a Quiz Bowl competition, but versus a feeble defensive opponent he's a signal caller that could provide all the right answers, especially with Jeremy Maclin likely back."

S'Running with the determination of a soccer mom hot after a FurrReal feline on Black Friday, "Silent Bob" made plenty of noise in his 201 total-yard, 3-TD shellacking of the Carolina Pansies, undeniably one of the greatest out-of-nowhere fantasy performances ever. Post-game Smith, like the one-percent of fantasy owners who had the HUEVOS to start him, was awestruck by what he accomplished. For a ground game which had struggled to establish consistency earlier this year, his stellar effort was just what the doctor ordered. On Turkey Thursday, don\'t be surprised if the slicing and dicing continues. As LeGarrette Blount showed last week, Green Bay has rarely stuffed the run this season. Over its past five games, the Pack has yielded 5.5 yards per carry, 131 total yards and four touchdowns to RBs. The still only 24-year-old Smith, displayed remarkable vision, versatility and surprising power last week. Incredibly, 84 of his 140 rushing yards were racked after contact. Given his fresh legs, prominent role within the offense and Green Bay\'s struggles in the trenches, he should be counted on for at least midlevel RB2 numbers in what should be a shootout. Only three weeks ago, Smith was watching football in his barcalounger. Now, he\'s in a prime position to carve up the NFL\'s only unblemished team in arguably the Motor City\'s biggest Thanksgiving tussle in decades.'

S"Alongside Michael Bush and Ben Tate, Stewart is a back who deserves an every-down, every-week gig. On the season, the grossly underused rusher has averaged a mere 11.6 touches per game. No longer just a power complement to DeAngelo Williams, the sidekick has become an indispensable check-down option for Cam Newton. Over his first three seasons in the league, he hauled in just 34 catches. In 2011, he's already grabbed 33. This week, his combination of power and versatility should prove problematic for the My Little Ponies. In terms of yielding fantasy points to running backs, Indy is a giver. On the year, it's conceded a staggering 178.6 total yards and 1.1 touchdowns per game to rushers equal to the third-most fantasy points allowed. Because the Colts offense is a heaping pile of suck, blowout potential in this contest is great. If Carolina does indeed build an insurmountable early lead, Stewart, D-Will and the ghost of Fred Lane, have terrific odds of racking RB2-level numbers. Yes, the Cam poach factor is a deterrent, but Stew Beef should garner at least 14-16 touches, a workload that could do serious damage against the Colts' D."

S'Ballyhooed rookies A.J. Green and Julio Jones, as expected, have met or, in the case of the Bengal, exceeded preseason expectations. Though his overall numbers pale in comparison, the less-publicized Brown is making a strong case to earn the rookie WR bronze. With Malcom Floyd sidelined by a hip injury, the homegrown product, who was a standout at Marshall Faulk-U (San Diego St.), has stepped in and showed up. Over the past three weeks, Philip Rivers has targeted him 19 times, connecting on 10 of those attempts for 184 yards and a touchdown. His subsequent 8.1 per game output in standard leagues checks in at No. 29 among WRs during that stretch, and that includes last week\'s 1-8-0 dud in Chicago. Likely to draw corner Andre\' Goodman, who ranks 77th in coverage according to Pro Football Focus (58.3 catch percentage-allowed), Brown and his "very natural instincts" and "good abilities," as Norv Turner describes them, will likely be showcased. Based on his matchup, Denver\'s suffocating play against the run and the Chargers\' inefficiencies on defense suggest Rivers will turn to the air early and often. Brown goes to town in Week 12.'

S"Gresham, standing at 6-foot-5, 261-pounds and blessed with bruising power and 4.7 40-yard speed, is an athletic version of Shrek. As Ravens strong safety Benard Pollard said last week, he's an offensive threat who can practically do it all. Despite his intimidating prowess and excellent on-field production \xe2\x80\x93 he currently ranks 10th in per game output among tight ends \xe2\x80\x93 many in the fantasy community have continued to give him the Heisman, indicative in his low start percentage. Mark my words, those who don't trust the Bengal this week will sorely regret it. Outside Joe Haden, Cleveland's pass defense is exploitable, especially for tight ends. Six plus-sized targets, including little used Marcedes Lewis last week, have scored double-digits in the n Effect. With A.J. Green expected to be in uniform, and likely to draw the Cleveland corner to his side, Gresham should wreak havoc across the middle. Recall in the first Buckeye Battle Week 1, he grabbed six balls for 58 yards and a touchdown. Expect the encore to be equally fruitful."

S'What exactly is in Jake\'s Locker? For starters, he\'s an exceptional leader who teammates gravitate toward. He also possesses a cannon arm. And, similar to fellow rookie Christian Ponder, he\'s very mobile, a true dual-threat. Replacing Matt Hasselbeck in the second-half last week in Atlanta, the Washington standout was superb throwing for 104 yards and two touchdowns, an impromptu performance Nate Washington called "awesome." If the veteran\'s sprained throwing elbow, an injury Mike Munchak calls "day-to-day," keeps him on the sidelines, Locker could get an opportunity to show-off his wares against one of the league\'s softest defenses, Tampa. The Bucs have allowed a league-worst 8.5 yards per attempt. More importantly, eight quarterbacks, including the likes of Curtis Painter and Alex Smith, have tallied at least 20 points in a game against them. Yes, occasional recklessness and poor accuracy are not Locker\'s finer attributes, but his competitive zeal, versatility and Howitzer arm are enough for him to shock the fantasy world, especially versus a meek opponent. Deep leaguers, the rookie could be Week 12\'s version of Kevin Smith.'

S"According to Michael Lombardi, Denver's original plan for Tebow was to appease the team's insatiable fan-base by allowing him to play. Essentially, John Elway wanted to wash his hands of the mess Josh McDaniels created. But the team president, like many, has become a convert, joining the masses in their praise of the Mile High Messiah. The same can't be said of the fantasy community. Many continue to give Tebow the stiff arm, evident in his low-start percentage. His gut-wrenching three quarters of ineffectiveness apparently is too much for most to bear. Y! colleague Michael Salfino is right. Tebow isn't the prettiest of passers. His mechanics are still greatly flawed and he's earned too much credit for wins generated not by supernatural forces, but by gifts the opposition has served on a silver platter (e.g. Marion Bartman, CHI's prevent defense). Credit to the QB, he's taken advantage. This week, however, could be all him. New England runs zone almost exclusively on defense. Injuries and a lack of talent has forced Bill Belichick into relying on the risky tactic. As a result, quarterbacks of various achievement levels have torched them. In total, 11 passers have surpassed the 20-point mark against the Pats, including the likes of Chad Henne, Jason Campbell and Dan Orlovsky. Yes, Tebow has made a number of quality NFL throws of late, especially downfield. Still, his best fantasy asset is and will remain his legs. Belichick will undoubtedly devise a game-plan to force Tebow into uncomfortable situations, but, if the Pats pile on the points early, the signal caller will no doubt find wide spaces open spaces to run wild. Based on the incredibly favorable matchup and possible catch-up element, it's conceivable the fantasy legend of No. 15 grows. In reality, a victory over the AFC Goliath may permanently erase doubts about his unrefined skills. With every improbable Tebow-led victory, an angel gets its wings. Start him, and you too could earn a divine reward."

S'The Noise, at the forefront of the Felix for Fantasy Stud movement back in August, may finally prove prophetic, in a way. It\'s quite plausible the underachieving rusher will lead owners to a fantasy championship after all, a laughable thought just a few days ago. Jones filled in brilliantly after rookie sensation DeMarco Murray was felled by a season-ending fractured ankle Sunday night against New York, totaling 137 yards while averaging 6.6 yards per carry. His century mark effort on the ground was only the third of his bland four-year career. Pegged as a breakout candidate preseason, Felix was expected to shoulder the load and cash-in on his first round promise. His situation was ripe \xe2\x80\x94 terrific offensive environment, emerging O-line, versatile skill set. Predictably, though, the peanut brittle back suffered a high ankle sprain Week 6, paving the way for Murray to overtake full-time duties. Now his chance at redemption has arrived. Don\'t expect him to (expletive) it up. No defense, not even the Carolina Pansies, has allowed more fantasy points to rushers this season than Tampa. Eight RBs since Week 7 have tallied at least 10 fantasy points against the Argh!-less Bucs. And on the season they\'ve yielded 4.8 yards per carry and a humiliating 172.1 total yards per game to the position. Yes, the relationship between Jones and his original owners is likely more toxic than Alec Baldwin\'s with American Airlines, but given his favorable matchup and likely 20-touch workload, the hatchet needs to be buried. In other words, Behrens, the answer is "Hell yes!"'

S"Want to survive and advance? Make a date with Tate. In the Michael Bush-Pierre Thomas-Jonathan Stewart vein of backs, the underappreciated backup deserves an every-down, every-week gig somewhere. However, despite averaging 5.6 yards per carry he will remain one of the game's premier vice-backs behind Arian Foster, especially if his recurring case of fumbilitis sticks around (He's fumbled once every 38.5 touches). Still, even with 11-14 touches, he should be trusted as a RB2 this week in 12-teamers. The Pansies have been consistently atrocious this season defending the run. LeGarrette Blount and Michael Turner are the only rushers who failed to record at least 8.5 points against them in 13 games. Overall, Ron Rivera's club has surrendered 4.9 yards per carry, 162.2 total yard per game and 1.4 touchdowns per game to RBs, equal to the second-most fantasy points allowed. T.J. Yates, coming off an impressive 300-yard performance, will undoubtedly play the Andy Benard role in the follow-up. A conservative game-plan makes sense considering the Texans offensive line completely outclasses Carolina's ineffective front. Houston's average high temperature in mid-December may be 63 degrees, but this is a team built for cold weather. Count on Foster and Tate to plow through the Panthers in Week 15."

S'Only on rare occasions has Sir Lancelot skewered the competition. Much like his revolving door at RB, Sean Payton, excluding Marques Colston, has shuffled his receivers in and out of the lineup. Moore, in particular, has been used sparingly. Since Week 9, he\'s averaged just 23 snaps per game, making his 7.7 points per week tally during that stretch quite impressive (2.9 snaps/point). But with Jimmy Graham ailing, the slippery receiver could see additional playing time. Graham, who complained of "excruciating" pain from start to finish in last week\'s game at Tennessee, is dealing with a bad back. An MRI Monday revealed no serious damage, but, it\'s clear, he\'s not operating at 100-percent. Moore, arguably the Saints\' best underneath weapon outside Graham, stands to benefit. If he sees an uptick in targets, he should thrive against Minnesota\'s rickety Cover 2. On the season, the Vikes have conceded the fourth-most fantasy points to wide receivers. In total, 13 wideouts have reached "Flame" territory against them. Moore is a gamble in shallow formats, but in deeper PPR leagues, he could definitely be a playoff Saint.'

S"For most teams, losing your most talented, productive wide receiver to an MCL sprain would be an irrecoverable blow. However, in the Land of the Offensively Spoiled, when the flag-bearer falls another soldier steps up to raise the colors. With Greg Jennings out, Jones should fill the void quite nicely. The long-bomb specialist has attracted just 2.8 targets on the season, but when pressed into more extensive action he's delivered. Last year in four starts, including the Super Bowl, he scored twice and averaged a laudable 5.3 receptions and 74.5 yards per game. His terrific blend of size and speed is problematic for most defenses, especially with the league's most accurate quarterback slinging passes in his direction. The Chiefs' Brandon Flowers and Brandon Carr have performed well this season. The duo's play is the primary reason why KC ranks sixth in fewest points allowed to WRs. However, even the league's stingiest secondaries are weakened by the Packers. And the tandem isn't immune from the occasional explosive pass play. On the year, they've given up a combined 14.6 yards per catch. Green Bay's WR roulette wheel will keep spinning, but the likelihood it lands on No. 89 is as strong as ever."

S'Just call the rookie the Hurt Locker. Why? He\'s about to rain pain on the competition. After Matt Hasselbeck exited last week\'s clash with New Orleans in the second quarter, the youngster, drafted eighth overall back in April, came in and showcased his mammoth potential. Exhibiting a bulldog demeanor, cannon arm and incredible athleticism, he finished with a 282-1, 36-1 line in roughly 2.5 quarters of play. His subsequent 27.7 point output ranked No. 7 among Week 14 passers. Post-game, Damian Williams praised his teammate describing him as a "heck of a ball player" who does "whatever you ask him to do \xe2\x80\x94 run, throw, create a play." Locker, like fellow rookie Cam Newton, is a fantasy Dreamsicle. His ability to score by air and land is very appealing. With Hasselbeck nursing a calf injury, all indications suggest the former Husky will make his starting debut against the woeful Colts. Indy, down several starters on defense, particularly in its secondary, is one of the league\'s most giving opponents. Seven quarterbacks have scored at least 20 fantasy points against it, including the aforementioned Dandy Cam in Week 12. Most would never think of rolling the dice on an unproven quarterback in his first NFL start, but Locker\'s playmaking zeal and versatility will be extremely difficult for the Colts to contain. Sack up, riverboat gamblers.'

S"Derek Jeter may award his conquests with a parting gift of signed goodies, but bed Vick's fantasy image against New York and you're bound to leave the playoffs empty-handed (Admission: I always left my hookups with a mind full of regrets). August's top QB pick floundered in his return to the lineup last week on South Beach. In total, he completed just 50-percent of his passes, throwing for just 208 yards (6.9 ypa) with a touchdown and a pick. More disappointingly, he chipped in just nine rushing yards. Obviously, Vick's line was suppressed due to Miami's susceptibility to turnovers in its own territory, but a thick layer of rust was visible on the quarterback. The good news: He escaped Pro Player Stadium with limbs intact. The bad news: Admittedly, his ribs still are not fully healed. His physical limitations and daunting matchup this week are major deterrents for those with reliable alternatives. The Jets have allowed only three multi-TD passers and 6.5 yards per attempt this season. Overall, they've yielded the fifth-fewest fantasy points to QBs. Rex Ryan's club is also an aggressive blitzing team, a frightening characteristic if you own the fragile quarterback. Vick remarked Monday he will need to bring his 'A' game to beat Darrelle Revis and company. Unfortunately, a playoff-eliminating 'C' grade is more likely."

S"Riding a sugar high since Week 4, the Skittles-munching back has rewarded his owners with a string of spectacular performances. During that nine-game stretch he's scored 10 touchdowns and averaged a whopping 114.1 total yards per game, ranking him inside the top-five in per week production. Setting his inner monster free, Lynch, who ran rather timidly earlier this season, has attacked holes, exploded around corners and dragged tacklers, triggering BeastQuakes throughout the greater Seattle area. He's only 31 yards short of becoming the 'Hawks' first 1,000-yard rusher since Shaun Alexander reached the milestone in 2004. Suffice it to say, the free-agent-to-be has made himself a ton of money. Because the rusher has accumulated RB1-level numbers against meek and mighty (e.g. Baltimore, Atlanta, Dallas, Cincinnati) competition, he's matchup proof in the eyes of many owners. To his supporters, his nine-game TD streak says it all. However, all good things must come to an end. The Bears, desperate for a victory, present his stiffest test yet. Since Week 6, no back has surpassed 75-yards on the ground against Chicago. In total, RBs have averaged just 3.3 yards per carry versus it over that span. Another burdensome workload is likely, but expect the Bears to get the best of the Beast."

S"It's been a revealing season for the Most Despised Back of 2010. After fighting through nagging injuries and a virulent strain of fumbilitis the former first-round pick is finally tapping into his mammoth potential. Exhibiting improvements across the board, particularly in the ball security department, he's ripped off three straight 100-yard games averaging 15.5 fantasy points per week since Week 12. However, matched against three suspect run defenses over that stretch \xe2\x80\x94 Denver, Buffalo and Jacksonville \xe2\x80\x94 he's feasted largely on the weak. Against more rigid competition, the Charger hasn't exactly produced a spark. Versus defenses ranked inside the top-10 in fewest fantasy points-allowed (Dolphins, Jets and Bears), he compiled a lowly 8.8 points per game. In other words, he's essentially a matchup-only play. The Ravens, who've yielded the second-fewest fantasy points to rushers this season, have allowed just 3.4 yards per carry. Arian Foster, Maurice Jones-Drew and Lynch are the only plowshares to eclipse the century mark in total yardage against them. And Ray Lewis' likely return this week only enhances their impregnability. Without question Mathews is a rising star in virtual pigskin, but until he slays a Goliath, he should remain untrustworthy."

S"Nude photos of Lindsay Lohan sans airbrushing. That's what Mendenhall's final Week 15 line will look like when time expires in San Francisco. This season has been rather unkind to the popular first-round pick. Injuries and ineffectiveness on the Steelers' offensive line combined with Bruce Arians' desire to throw has caused Mendenhall's production to spiral downward. Ranked 24th in per week average (10.6 points per game in standard formats) among RBs, the former workhorse has logged only one 20-carry game. With three double-digit fantasy efforts in his past five, the ex-Illini has undergone a small resurgence, but last week stonewalled four consecutive times at the goal-line by the Browns, one of the league's most pliable run defenses, it's clear he's far from reliable. Keep in mind he's eclipsed the 85 total yard mark only once this season. The Niners are an unconquerable fortress up front. Patrick Willis, Ahmad Brooks, Aldon Smith and Justin Smith each ranks inside the top-12 at their respective positions stuffing the run according to Pro Football Focus. On the season, no rusher has crossed the chalk or surpassed 65 rush yards against them. Because Mendenhall is rarely used in the pass game, he's essentially Beanie Wells in black, a rusher San Fran limited to 63 total yards in two games. Unless you're purposely trying to throw your second round playoff game, the Steeler should not be trusted under any circumstances. Ben Roethlisberger, assuming he starts, will be the point of emphasis for Pittsburgh."

S'Entering 2011, many doubted the four-time Pro Bowler would reascend to prominence. Many considered Cam Newton a raw passer whose progressions and intermediate accuracy were unproven and unpolished. However, Newton set the tone immediately Week 1, breaking Peyton Manning\'s record for most passing yards by a rookie in a game. Smith caught eight passes for 178 yards and two scores in that contest, his best single-game output since 2005. He\'s delivered a few standout performances since. Because Smith has drawn constant double-teams, which Newton admits has made it "physically impossible" to force passes to No. 89\'s side, the receiver has fallen on hard times. Since Week 10, he\'s the 41st-best wideout in points per game. His chances of bouncing back against one of the most underrated secondaries in the league are fairly slim. According to Pro Football Focus, Houston DB Jonathan Joseph is the NFL\'s finest cover corner. On the year, WRs are performing 12.8-percent below the league average against the Texans. Only five pass catchers have totaled 80 yards against them, none since Week 6. Smith, the 35th player in NFL history to hit the 10,000-yard mark, has been one of the nicest comeback stories in virtual pigskin this year, but with greenbacks on the line don\'t bank on him booming.'

S'When Moore seized the reins of the \'Fins\' starting job back in Week 4, owners were unsure what passer would show up. Would it be the QB that posted an impeccable 8:0 td:int ratio over the final four weeks of 2009? Or perhaps the abomination that lost out to waste of space Jimmy Clausen the following season? Based on his 230.3 yards per game and 7:1 td:int split since Week 9, it appears the more palatable side has resurfaced. Three reasons explain Moore\'s resurgence: 1) Protection. Sacked 16 times in his first four starts, he\'s only been forced to the ground seven times since. 2) Aggressiveness. He\'s taken numerous shots downfield, particularly to Brandon Marshall, indicative in his eye-opening 8.6 yards per attempt in his last four. 3) Offensive balance. Brian Daboll\'s installation of tosses and sweeps for Reggie Bush has kept defenses honest, opening up opportunities in the pass game. If all the ingredients again come together, Moore should deliver sweet totals this week versus visiting Oakland. Nine signal callers in 11 games have registered at least two touchdowns against the Raiders secondary. Hue Jackson\'s crew has also allowed the fourth-most fantasy points to QBs on the year. Though Moore has been, as Bush noted recently, "a huge, huge difference-maker," the Miami front office continues to scour the college landscape for its future franchise quarterback (RGIII anyone?). But with five games left to prove his mettle, the once maligned Panther could deliver a string of performances to remember, beginning this week. Stream away.'

S'Nearly disbarred  in fantasy\'s court of judgement a few weeks ago, the LawFirm is finally back doing what he does best: dropping the gavel on would-be tacklers. Earlier this season, a toe injury of unknown severity and a lack of commitment to the run game paralyzed the rusher\'s numbers. From Weeks 6-10, he averaged a useless 3.4 points per game. But with back-to-back double-digit efforts, Green-Ellis is primed for stellar stretch run. Expect his resurrection to continue this week versus Indy. To call the defeated Colts "awful" would be a massive understatement. Just down the turnpike, the 1-10 Indiana Hoosiers might have a shot against them. Though terrible everywhere, defending the run might be Indy\'s greatest weakness. Eleven rushers in 11 games have scored at least 10 standard points against it. On the year, the My Little Ponies have yielded 4.3 yards per carry, 176.1 total yards per game and 13 TDs to RBs, equal to the third-most fantasy points allowed. Because Tom Brady will operate uninhibitedly, creating several goal-to-go situations, the bruiser has excellent odds of punching in a touchdown or three. Pick up the phone.'

S'In a mad dash of fantasy shopping, the Noise, unapologetically, would pepper spray his fellow leaguemates for the PT Bruiser\'s services. As most are aware, my man-crush runs very, very deep. Without question last year\'s busted season seriously tested my dedication. But quietly useful over the past several weeks, the adoration for Thomas is as strong as ever. Since Week 9, PT has netted 11.1 points per game in standard formats (even more in PPR leagues), scoring in three of four games, good for the 17th-best RB output during that stretch. Sean Payton\'s revolving door of running backs remains tough to decipher. The coach, just before Monday\'s shrinking of the Giants, admitted he had yet to determine how his stable of rushers would be used, a "problem" Chan Gailey could only dream about. Clearly, though, Thomas has earned a bigger piece of the pie, evident in his rising snap count and overall performance. In his past three games, PT, running with vintage vim and vigor, has averaged a redonkulous 7.2 yards per touch.  Darren Sproles and Mark Ingram will definitely carve out significant roles, but, this week, against a potentially Suh-less Lions defense, the ex-Illini could inflict measurable damage. Even with The Stomper in uniform, Detroit has surrendered 4.7 yards per carry to RBs this year. No doubt Drew Brees and company will turn to the air early and often, but, considering the Lions\' vulnerability up front, a heavier than normal workload could be in store for Thomas. Turn the key.'

S'It\'s true Tim Tebow could stop an avalanche with a fingertip, but the Mile High Messiah is also capable of transforming a middle-of-the-road wideout into a near must-start in competitive formats. Though he\'s failed to reach 75 yards with Mr. Fourth Quarter under center, The Disciple has become a true consistency king, splashing six in four of his past five games. Equipped with "iron lungs," according to his mentor and workout buddy Larry Fitzgerald, Decker is the consumate max-effort guy. He, like Tebow, simply outworks defenses. This week he may barely break a sweat. The Vikings, sans Antoine Winfield, are positively dreadful versus the pass. Without the corner, they\'ve allowed 8.3 yards per attempt. Overall, they\'ve yielded the third-most fantasy points to wide receivers. Ten WRs have finished in \'Flame\' territory against them. Yes, Tebow has only thrown 22 passes twice in six starts \xe2\x80\x94 and he would have a hard time hitting the Jolly Green Giant in the chest on 50-percent of those tosses \xe2\x80\x94 but given the friendly opponent it\'s certainly conceivable he could turn to the air 25-plus times. If that happens count on Decker attracting 7-9 of those attempts. Become a follower.'

S"Higgins would definitely agree the Magnum P.I. of tight ends has a high-ceiling in Week 13. Earlier this season, Celek was forced to stay in the box to protect Michael Vick from a barrage of blitzes. As a result, his numbers suffered greatly. From Weeks 1-5, he failed to record a top-20 week. But since then, he's become an integral part of the Eagles offense. Over his past five contests, he's attracted a healthy 7.7 targets per game reeling in 5.5 receptions for 64.0 yards and two touchdowns. This week he should continue to soar in the Battle of the Birds. Seattle, similar to Chicago, is a club that believes TEs have cooties. Oversized targets have performed 53.3 percent above the league average against the 'Hawks since Week 8. Jason Witten, Ed Dickson and Fred Davis, the last three TEs Seattle has faced, each crossed the chalk. No matter if Vick or Vince Young runs the show Thursday, Celek should finish well inside the position's top-12."

S"Citizens of Fantasyland are understandably giddy about Chris Johnson's revival, but the terribly underrated Williams has also created a stir, albeit a much smaller one. Over the past five weeks, the wideout has splashed pay-dirt three times averaging a respectable 3.4 receptions and 50 yards per game. His subsequent 8.4 points per week output during that span checks in at No. 26 among wide receivers. In hot water earlier this season with offensive coordinator Chris Palmer for not playing up to his full potential, the fringe commodity barely registered a blip on most owner radars. But now with the confidence of his OC, head coach and, most importantly, quarterback, the USC product is wielding a sharpened sword. Look for him to plunge it into the heart of Buffalo. Bumbling defensively, the Bills have given up seven scores to WRs in their past four games. Aaron Williams, the Titan's likely shadow, has been particularly generous, conceding 13.5 yards per catch and a 64.7 catch percentage. Because he has only one 70-plus yard performance on his 2011 resume, don't expect banner numbers from Williams. But a profitable day could be in the offing for the emerging WR3."

S"Over the past five weeks, Matty Ice has been hotter than being the cream filling in a Han and Hope Solo love-Twinkie. Since Week 8, he's averaged 24.4 points per game in standard formats (8.5 ypa, 301 ypg, 9:2 td:int split), good for the sixth-best output among signal callers. The reason for his reascension is twofold: 1) He's reconnected with top target Roddy White, 2) Mike Mularkey has finally incorporated no-huddle more into the game-plan which has allowed the quick-thinking QB to flourish. Two weeks ago against Tennessee, in one of his finest efforts of the season, he operated out of the formation on roughly 45-50 snaps. The quick pace has kept defenses off-guard, helping the QB remain upright. During his recent fiery stretch he's been sacked just 1.0 time per game compared to 2.6 times over the season's first seven weeks. However, the Texans, arguably the league's most underappreciated defense, will likely extinguish the passer's hot hand. Houston has yielded just 5.9 yards per attempt, two multi-TD games and a pair of 200-plus yard performances to QBs this year. For a unit that was embarrassed often last year, the additions of DB Jonathan Joseph and coordinator Wade Phillips has done wonders. Everything may be big in Texas, but this week Ryan's numbers could be small."

S"The 'Other' Bush has likely made himself a multi-millionaire brilliantly filling the void for injured star Darren McFadden. He's routinely displayed the humiliating power, toughness and versatility needed to be an All-Pro level workhorse. In four starts he's averaged an insane 148.3 total yards per game (5.2 yards per touch), splashing the invisible pool in each game. RB-starved franchises will likely sacrifice limbs for the free-agent-to-be's services during the offseason. The Raiders O-line also deserves a hat-tip, but clearly the rusher's earned an every-down, every-week gig. It's true Bush moves the Noise's man-meter, but, speaking objectively, he isn't a slam dunk RB1 this week in Miami. Undoubtedly, he'll shoulder another burdensome workload, but the 'Fins, like the Bears last week, are one of the league's best at plugging gaps. Cameron Wake and company have limited RBs to just 3.7 yards per carry, 126.5 total yards per game and only two touchdowns, equal to the third-fewest fantasy points allowed. Only Ben Tate back in Week 2 eclipsed the 90 rushing yard mark against the 'Fins. In a hostile environment and against a surging opponent, the Man in Black falls into a 'Ring of Fire.'"

S"A cold, early December game usually means it's time to deck the Mendenhall, but in a critical AFC North battle its doubtful his owners will feel jolly. It's been an unusual year for the former Illinois standout. One of the league's rare workhorses last year, his workload has decreased dramatically. Bruce Arians, more air-minded compared to the past, has called the rusher's number 20 times in a game only once. In 19 games a season ago, including the playoffs, he shouldered that load nine times. The offensive lines poor execution has also sapped his productivity. Last week against the league's seventh-most generous run defense, Kansas City, Mendenhall did his best CJ2Lame impersonation running for three yards or fewer on nine of 17 carries. Yes, he did record a 19.0 fantasy point day against Cincy three weeks ago, but his 2.9 ypc left a lot to be desired. In the rematch Geno Atkins, one of the best run stuffers in the NFL, gets the best of him. Keep in mind only Willis McGahee and Ray Rice have surpassed 90 rushing yards in a game against the Bengals this season. Fa la la la la, la la la lame."

S"Volatility is the name of the game for V-Jax. Some weeks he'll guide you to the Promised Land. Other weeks he'll rain on your parade, Nick Novak style. Four times he's eclipsed 17-points in a game. And seven times he's failed to reach even a third of that amount. This week expect more of the latter. Like the franchise as a whole, which was sold to Illinois grad Shahid Kahn and fired long-time head coach Jack Del Rio earlier this week, the Jags secondary is in a state of flux. When starting corners Rashean Mathis and Derek Cox were placed on injured reserve many believed the unit was irreparable. However, that hasn't been the case. William Middleton, working as a starter and part-timer, has handcuffed the opposition, holding assignments to just 8.6 yards per catch. His battery mate, Drew Coleman, has played equally well allowing just 9.0 yards per catch. Talent level doesn't always dictate executability. Many times it's the system that does. No doubt Jackson is one of the league's premier playmakers, but because Jacksonville doesn't give up many explosive pass plays, and due to Philip Rivers' wild inconsistency, he could again fade into the background."

S'Counting on any receiver, no matter how accomplished, in his first game back from a major lower body injury is risky business. Just ask those who trusted Andre Johnson in Week 12. Though he\'s yet to return to the practice field, Jerry Jones, who disclosed Tuesday he really "missed" Miles (Yep, Laurent Robinson really stunk up the joint with No. 19 on the shelf), believes his top receiver will return this week against Arizona. Most would automatically assume he\'s must-start material if active, but given the fickle nature of hamstring injuries he\'s far from it. Expect him to be eased back into action. Arizona\'s much improved secondary is also a major deterrent. Burned repeatedly earlier this season, young corners Patrick Peterson and A.J. Jefferson have started to tap into their mammoth potentials. Since Week 8, the duo has yielded just two receiver touchdowns and a pair of 85-plus yard performances, ranking in the top-third in fewest points-allowed to WRs. When firing on all cylinders, Austin is one of the virtual game\'s elites. His 10.7 points per game output checks in at No. 12 among WRs in standard formats. But the former Kardashian canoodler could be \'booty\' in his return. Based on his likely accumulated rust, bland matchup and Dallas\' recommitment to the run, he deserves to ride the pine one more week.'

S"Last week, the Noise penned 800 words of hyperbole on why Stafford is not only a certifiable QB1 in 12-teamers, but also in the unchallenging six-team Smith Family fantasy football league (Nice job, Gramps). This week, look for the sleeping Lion to roar loudly in his 2011 debut. Aqib Talib and ageless wonder Ronde Barber are key components in the Buccs' secondary. Despite Barber's 36-year-old body, the unit is above average as a whole. Last year, it surrendered just 6.4 yards per attempt and the third-fewest 20-plus yards pass plays in the league. Still, Calvin Johnson is an untamable beast who would give the '85 Bears' defensive backfield fits. Combine that with Tampa's thin presence up front, and it could be a lights out performance for No. 9. Give Stafford time and he will punish you. Coming off a preseason in which he averaged 12.4 yards per attempt, the signal caller is poised to storm out the gate with guns blazing."

S'Discussed at length in Monday\'s "First Down," Wells enters 2011 as Arizona\'s unquestioned workhorse. Though we\'ve cast the former Buckeye in an unflattering light even before he logged his first NFL carry, we fully expect him to bury his "Weenie" side once and for all. This preseason Wells has ran with newfound assertiveness, picking up sizable yards after contact. Consistency, however, remains key. And don\'t fret over newly acquired backup Chester Taylor. He\'s only a long-term insurance policy. Beanie\'s Week 1 opponent, Carolina, has talent on the defensive line, but much of it rests on the edges. Interiorly, the Panthers are extremely vulnerable, especially after the losing Ron Edwards to a biceps injury early in the preseason. With rookie Sione Fua filling the void, Wells will have no problem eating up yards between the hashmarks. If Kevin Kolb and Larry Fitzgerald should get on the same page quickly, Arizona could build up an insurmountable lead early giving way to Beanie to eat clock late. Long overdue, it\'s time for "Meanie" to emerge.'

S"One overlooked takeaway from the preseason: the Football Frankenstein is back and possibly better than ever. The reanimated monster, presumably motivated by money \xe2\x80\x94 he could cash in $2 million in incentives with a good year \xe2\x80\x94 showcased the devastating power and burst that made him a fantasy star just three years ago. In two exhibition games, he averaged 6.2 yards per carry, plowing over Bears and Jets first-teamers. Unless Mike Shanahan deploys a ravenous sloth of grizzles on defense, it's highly unlikely the 'Skins will be able to contain him. Recall Washington's transition from a base 4-3 to 3-4 didn't go smoothly last year. The 'Skins allowed a whopping 4.6 yards per carry and 157.4 total yards per game to rushers. There's hope for improvement, but Jim Haslett's bunch is still a work in progress. Considering the 'Skins' equally lackluster secondary, it's very likely Jacobs will be presented with numerous goal-line opportunities. Plug him in at the flex."

S"Usually recommending a rookie wide receiver in his first pro game is akin to running out of a grocery story with a piping-hot rack of ribs stuffed in your pants \xe2\x80\x94 not a sage idea. But the IPO on Jones shouldn't be missed. At 6-foot-3, 220-pounds, the wideout is a terrific blend of size, speed and power. His physical advantage over diminutive Bears corner Tim Jennings (5-foot-8, 185-pounds) is immense. Yes, the Chicago Cover 2 only surrendered 10 WR touchdowns in 2010, but you have to like the matchup. The Bears are stingy up front, which could force Matt Ryan, who threw 42 times in one half Week 3 of the preseason, airborne often. Add that to the attention Roddy White and Tony Gonzalez will draw, and Jones has strong odds of double-digit targets. Trust him as a WR2/3 in 12-team and deeper leagues."

S'It\'s true Banana Hands is the last partner you would want in an egg-toss competition, but for the purpose of this game, he\'s a dependable option \xe2\x80\x94 that is, for this week. "Laughable" best describes Seattle\'s performance against the pass last year. The \'Hawks secondary gave up 7.2 yards per attempt and the second-most 20-yard pass plays in the league. Corner Marcus Trufant is an above average tackler with fair coverage skills who is respectable. However, his partner, Brandon Browner, a graduate of the CFL, is the antithesis of a sure-thing. The former Stampeder has the size (6-foot-4, 210-pounds) to compete with Braylon, but his cover skills are sketchy. No matter who Edwards draws, Alex Smith is bound to test the tandem downfield. If the recently signed free agent smothers his hands in honey, expect him to strike it rich in his first game as a Gold Panner.'

S"Defensive trends aren't often static. Due to the league's year-to-year turnover and general evolution, no two seasons are generally the same. However, in the case of Philadelphia's approach to tight ends one result is constant: loads of fantasy points. Over the past three seasons, the Eagles have ranked in the top-eight in fantasy points allowed to TEs every year. Considering its shortcomings at linebacker and safety, Philly will likely again struggle in this facet of the game \xe2\x80\x94 great news for Kendricks. The Rams' preseason leader in receptions (11) has established an instant bond with Sam Bradford. Blessed with superb size, hands and athleticism, the rookie is a matchup nightmare for roaming linebackers over the middle. Due to the presence of Nnamdi Asomugha, Dominque Rodgers-Cromartie and Asante Samuel in the Eagles secondary, Bradford may lean on his gifted tight end to move the chains. If Philly's bashfulness picking up oversized targets carries over, Kendricks will be the hottest post-Week 1 waiver grab at the position. Beat your opponents to the punch."

S"For the avid golfer, an opening week matchup against the Jets in the NYC is as menacing as the par four, 495-yard 9th hole at Pebble Beach on a damp, blustery day. As many a quarterback is familiar, the dynamic duo of Darrelle Revis and Antonio Cromartie is very intimidating. When healthy and executing at its highest level the tandem can hold any accomplished QB hostage, especially one coming off a long hiatus. Romo hasn't competed in a regular season game since Week 7 last year. The rust, at least initially, will likely be visible. Combine that with an unproven, young offensive line facing a ferocious blitzing defense, and Romo could be badgered often, leading to several misconnections and turnovers. Yes, the Jets allowed seven multi-TD passers a season ago, but in the first game of 2011 with all defensive parts operating at full capacity, wise owners with sound backup options will avoid Romo."

S'In his hometown return, the former Northern Illinois standout may be crowned homecoming queen. The Bears secondary may have its hands full stopping Roddy White, Julio Jones and Tony Gonzalez, but, in the trenches, the Burner will be extinguished. As Mike Smith told reporters Wednesday, Chicago\'s front seven are "outstanding," a unit that plays with "great pad level" and is "very disruptive." Historically, the Bears have feasted on north-south runners, particularly at home. Even the league\'s most dynamic backs have often left Soldier Field battered and bruised. Last year, for example, Adrian Peterson managed just 51 yards on 17 carries Week 10 in the Windy City. Overall, in eight home contests in 2010, the Bears surrendered just 3.8 yards per carry to visiting rushers. Though the Falcons are likely to install a more pass-happy system, Turner should still get his customary 17-22 carries. But keep in mind he\'ll cede touches to Jason Snelling and Jacquizz Rodgers on third downs. This week, expect his inner-Benson to surface.'

S"Over the years, Steely McBeam has ramrodded Rice. In five games, the fourth-year back has failed to cross the chalk and racked a vanilla 4.2 yards per carry and 77.8 total yards per game. To soften the Steelers in the trenches, Rice will undoubtedly be deployed early and often. He will also play a substantial role within the passing game as Joe Flacco's primary check-down receiver. However, due to Troy Polamalu's ubiquitous nature, many of those touches will likely go for marginal gains. Without question, Rice is an elite back who is must-start material almost every week in PPR formats. But in standard leagues, the consensus top-five pick deserves to ride the pine. Recall in that format last year, only three backs (Cedric Benson, BenJarvus Green-Ellis and Fred Jackson) surpassed 12 fantasy points in a game against the Steelers. Don't count on the Uncle Ben's of fantasy to do the same."

S"Earlier in the week, news Tyler Palko was expected to replace injured starter Matt Cassel crushed Bowe owners' Week 1 hopes. However, now that the incumbent is in line to take first-team snaps, many are optimistic his primary weapon will deliver big opening week numbers. Think again. Sunday's tilt with Buffalo will be the Jamaal Charles show. Last year, the JC of KC piled up 238 total yards on 26 touches against the Bills. A full season of Shawne Merriman should help solidify the Buff's run defense, but not completely. This is still an exploitable unit that will get gashed often. Bowe will likely net a handful of targets, but, similar to last year (3-16-1 in Week 8), the end result will be unspectacular. Minus Tony Moeaki and Jonathan Baldwin, additional coverage over-the-top is a real possibility, especially if Steve Breaston is unable to stretch the field. Keep in mind Drayton Florence, Terrence McGee and Leodis McKelvin surrendered just 61.8 yards per game to No. 1s in '10. In the Charles exhibition, RamBowe will discharge little ammunition."

S'Since the lockout was lifted in late July, it\'s been tough sledding for Maclin. Hampered by a mysterious virus that trimmed 15 pounds off his frame, he\'s recuperated slowly. Now healthy and supposedly "ready for Week 1," many are unsure just how prepared the receiver is. After all, he only returned to practice roughly two weeks ago and didn\'t log a single snap in the preseason. Playing in front of dozens of family and friends in his hometown of St. Louis, he will be motivated to perform. But the lost work could pay a toll. And Michael Vick has plenty of weapons. DeSean Jackson, LeSean McCoy, Jason Avant and even Brent Celek could be the focus of the offensive game-plan, assuming No. 7 isn\'t tattooed repeatedly. Under normal circumstances, Maclin would be deemed reliable, but the extended lay-off is reason enough to ride him on the pine if you have favorable secondary options (e.g. Kenny Britt (at Jac), Nate Burleson (at TB), Braylon Edwards (vs. Sea), Mario Manningham (at Was), Davone Bess (vs. NE)).'

S"As the old saying goes, you're only as good as those around you. For the 2011 version of Cassel, that quote definitely applies. Over the first three weeks of the season the Chiefs resembled a low-level MAC team. The crippling losses of Jamaal Charles and Eric Berry sent the club on the fast-track to Andrew Luck. But ripping off four-consecutive wins, the former basement-dweller suddenly finds itself tied atop the AFC West. Keep this up, and Todd Haley will have the ability to braid his disoriented beard, Captain Lou Albano-style, in short order. With the rushing attack, spearheaded by Jackie Battle, resurrected and given the sudden emergence of beastly rookie Jonathan Baldwin, the KC offense, once on life support, is again up and running. No shock, Cassel's numbers have benefited greatly during the turnaround. Unable to reach the 17-fantasy point plateau during the Chiefs' opening three-game skid, he has surpassed the mark three times since, accumulating points by air (234.8 passing yards per game) and even land (11 yards per game). Against the defeated Dolphins the good times should keep rolling. Miami's secondary, battered by injuries and ineptitude, has surrendered 8.1 yards per attempt, 282.1 passing yards and 2.0 passing touchdowns per game this year, equal to the fourth-most fantasy points allowed. In fact, only Philip Rivers in Week 4 failed to find the end-zone multiple times against it. Considering Miami could be minus top corner Vontae Davis yet again, the signal caller should have little difficulty finishing in QB1 territory. Slide the White Cassel into your lineup, Matthew Stafford and Cam Newton enthusiasts."

S"According to Raheem Morris, Blount, sidelined by a sprained MCL since Week 5, is expected to return to practice and start this week in 'Nawlins. For fantasy purposes, his timing could not be more impeccable. The Saints, coming off a humiliating loss to the rancid Rams, were steamrolled by Steven Jackson, yielding 159 yards and a pair of touchdowns to the beast. S-Jax was the third 100-yard back New Orleans has allowed in its past four games. On the season, the Saints have now yielded 5.8 yards per carry to rushers. Noteworthy free agent acquisition Shaun Rogers, who was supposed to help remedy New Orleans' trench ills, has failed to deliver. On its defensive front only Sedrick Ellis ranks as an above average run stopper according to Pro Football Focus. Blount missed the division rivals' initial clash, but Earnest Graham's 17-109-0 line in Week 6 suggests the incumbent could exceed triple digits in his return. Keep in mind with Graham toast, the second-year back, who's shown significant improvement as a receiver this year, is expected to see extra snaps on third downs, enhancing his chances for a top-flight day in any format. Roll him up. Light him up. Smoke him up. Inhale. Exhale."

S"Greene, ostracized by many in the fantasy community for his valueless string of early season performances, appears to have turned a corner. Since Rex Ryan reemphasized a ground and pound approach three weeks ago, the once beleaguered back has returned to his defender flattening ways. Over his past three contests, he's netted a useful 89.7 rushing yards per game, including a 112-yard thrashing of the Chargers, his first 100-yard effort since Week 4 of last year. With the Jets offensive line finally creating sizable holes, Greene is finally finding daylight. Look for him to truck through wide lanes in Buffalo. The Bills, one of the league's most generous run defenses, have allowed 4.6 yards per carry and five double-digit RB performances on the season. The back's bullish, downhill running style should prove problematic for a unit that struggled mightily to contain Cedric Benson, a back with similar skills as Greene, in Week 4 (19-104-0). Prepare for takeoff."

S'After emerging as a reliable WR3 last year, Crabtree was expected to take a sizable step forward in 2011. This season marked his third-year in the league, a time when many talented receivers experience a breakout. However, a lingering foot injury hobbled him throughout the preseason, temporarily stunting his statistical growth. Over the first five weeks of the season, he failed to eclipse the 7-point threshold in standard formats. Now at full-strength, it appears he\'s finally come out of his shell. He\'s run great routes of late, gaining separation from defenders with relative ease. Though Alex Smith has overthrown him on a number of occasions, "Mariah," who is rather fond of the spotlight, has definitely thrived under increased pressure. Since Week 4 he\'s averaged a weighty 9.5 targets per game. Including last Sunday\'s 5-54-1 performance against Joe Haden and the Browns, he has 14 receptions for 131 yards over the past two weeks. The \'Skins have defended the pass fairly well this season, conceding just two touchdowns to wideouts. But DeAngelo Hall, who will likely shadow Crabs, is no shutdown corner. Quarterbacks have completed 75.6-percent of their attempts against him this year. Pan for gold.'

S"Since seizing the starting reins early last year, the artist formerly known as Ron Mexico has treated Celek as though he was his alleged past personified. Practically ignored by the passer, the tight end, once a fairly reliable fantasy starter, vanished from owner rosters, cast aside for upstarts Fred Davis, Scott Chandler and Jake Ballard. But with 18 targets, 11 receptions, 136 yards and two touchdowns over the past two weeks, he's definitely back on the fantasy radar. Wisely, Vick, blitzed repeatedly this season, has leaned on the safety valve, finding his oversized target often in the short-to-intermediate field. Matched against a very accommodating Bears defense, the badgered QB may again look often to his savior. No defense has contained tight ends more poorly than Chicago. In fact, TEs are performing a staggering 41.8-percent above the league average against it. Over their past five games, the Bears have allowed six touchdowns to the position. With a growing role in an explosive offense and blessed with a sensational matchup, Magnum P.I. is a strong play in Week 9. Don't trust him, and Higgins will be very displeased."

S'Revenge is one of humanity\'s greatest motivators. Ogbonnaya hopes to serve it cold. Just three weeks ago, the little known rusher was kicked to the curb by the Texans, an uneventful footnote for 99.9-percent of fantasy owners. However, now as a Cleveland Brown, the suddenly relevant rusher could face his former employer as a starter. Pat Shurmur revealed Monday Montario Hardesty is out indefinitely with a calf tear. Meanwhile, Peyton Hillis, hampered by a nagging hamstring injury, remains "day-to-day." If the Madden-jinxed rusher is unavailable, the former Texan and Houston native will net his first NFL start. The 25-year-old has played decently in limited action, working primarily as a third-down/passing back. Last week on 16 touches (five receptions) against the league\'s stingiest run defense, San Francisco, he racked 61 yards. Because the Browns\' West Coast offense typically features RBs in the passing game, Ogbonnaya would be a serviceable RB2/Flex option in a pinch, particularly in PPR formats. Houston has allowed 4.5 yards per carry to RBs this year. On roughly 20 touches, it\'s possible the motivated rusher could total surprising numbers in his hometown. (If starting)'

S"In his first battle against Baltimore Week 1, Roethlisberger was fortunate to emerge from the beat-down with head still attached. Sacked four times and forced into five turnovers, he succumbed repeatedly to the Ravens' relentless pressure. Since then, though, Big Ben has clocked the competition. Over his past four games he's posted a 11:2 td:int split and averaged a hefty 288.5 passing yards per game. Excluding Jacksonville, however, many of his recent opponents would struggle containing a one-legged Tim Tebow. Tennessee, Arizona and New England all rank in the bottom half of the league in pass defense. Clearly the strength of the Ravens defense is defending the run, but Ed Reed and friends are no slouches against the pass. They have not surrendered a multi-TD passer this season and they've not allowed a 230-yard passer since Week 2. Speed demons Mike Wallace and Antonio Brown are a handful for any secondary, but Baltimore has done a fantastic job of bracketing deep-threats downfield, yielding a mere 16 pass plays of 20-plus yards, the second-lowest number in the league. Plus, Roethlisberger has logged only marginal success against the division rival in recent clashes, scoring 20 fantasy points only once in his past six turns. Weighing history and how suffocating the Ravens have played recently, predicting Big Ben a lame is a no-brainer."

S"(or Mike Tolbert) It never ceases to amaze how quickly the tables can turn in fantasy. Entering Week 8, Mathews was the indisputable workhorse in the Chargers backfield. After he racked 123.8 total yards per game over his previous four contests, most believed, despite constant nicks and scrapes, he was finally living up to the mammoth expectations fanalysts placed on him as a rookie. Sadly, one nasty case of fumbilits and a strained groin later, and he again has the appearance of a committee back. According to local sources, his status for this week's tango with the Packers is in serious doubt, especially given the short week. Practice reports Thursday and Friday will ultimately determine his availability. However, even if he goes, don't expect spectacular totals. Green Bay was ripped for 175 yards and a score pre-bye by Adrian Peterson, but it's still allowed just 3.3 yards per carry and the eighth-fewest fantasy points to plowshares this season. Unless Philip Rivers rediscovers his mojo, he could find little daylight. All elements combined, the second-year back's short, and potentially long-term, worth is very cloudy. If the Charger is officially unplugged Sunday, count on Tolbert, who will be scored in this space in Mathews' stead (if necessary), only as a back-end RB2 in standard formats. The Pack, fresh off the bye, will likely jolt the sliding Bolts."

S'Two weeks ago, Murray, after establishing a new team record for rushing yards in a game, became fantasy\'s latest "it" player. But even after a solid encore performance in a blowout loss at Philadelphia (8-74-0), his RB1 days may be behind him. Before you know it, his initial fame, fortune and high rank on several "hot" lists will give way to work ethic questions, drug addiction, jail and, the ultimate nail in the career coffin, displaying your goods for a once iconic magazine barely staying afloat in a digital age. Hey, it could happen. Indications are Murray will soon undergo a value makeover, possibly starting this week. Felix Jones\' potential return could transform the rookie into a committee back. Jason Garrett hinted Wednesday he\'s toying with the idea of installing a two-back system. Under that scenario, Murray would function as the early-down back with Jones working as a Kevin Faulk-like change-of-pace, but game flow, as always, would determine distribution, a maddening proposition. No matter how many carries the youngster logs this week, don\'t anticipate banner numbers. Seattle boasts one of the league\'s fiercest run defenses. On the season, the \'Hawks have allowed just 3.1 yards per carry and 85.9 rushing yards per game to RBs, equal to the third-fewest fantasy points allowed. Only Montario Hardesty has surpassed the 80-yard mark against them this year. And it took the Brown 33 carries to do it. Undoubtedly, Murray has star potential, but based on his unfavorable matchup and unpredictable workload, he\'s avoidable in shallow leagues.'

S"Boldin, motivated against his former employer, was in full-on destructo mode last week against Arizona. Limited only by Joe Flacco's sketchy execution, he hauled in a game high seven catches for 145 yards, marking the second time in three games he's eclipsed the century mark. However, the degree of difficulty in this week's matchup is significantly higher. Overall, Mike Tomlin's club has yielded the fewest fantasy points to WRs this season. In fact, only two wideouts have reached double-digits against it. Coincidentally, Boldin was one of them. In the rematch, look for Pittsburgh to exact its revenge. Keep in mind quarterbacks have completed just 30.4 percent of their passes against Ike Taylor, Boldin's probable shadow. Only Darrelle Revis has dashed more attempts. Physical, hard-nosed battles typically favor the gritty receiver. But in a critical division battle on the road, the Raven gets Steely McBeamed."

S"Historically, the Chargers are a team tight ends have throttled. Over the past several years they've ranked perennially in the top-10 in points allowed to the position, a strange outcome for a club that understands how damaging a tight end can be. However, this year, San Diego has actually devoted more resources to defending the position, doing a fairly good job overall. Outside the twin-killing provided by Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez Week 2, TEs have done little when facing SD. In fact, oversized targets are performing 43.9-percent below the league average against the Bolts. Finley, again, is sure to garner plenty of attention, a feeling he's all too familiar with. Double-teamed often this year, which has forced Aaron Rodgers to look elsewhere, the uber-athletic target has greatly frustrated his followers. Takeaway his TD hat-trick in Chicago, and he's barely posted starter-worthy numbers in deep leagues. Over the past four weeks he's attracted a mere 4.8 targets per game, grabbing 2.8 receptions for 32.0 yards per game. Brandon Funston would lead you to believe this is Finley's week to break out. But defensive coordinator Greg Manusky's newfound commitment to stopping TEs says temper expectations."

S"Fluid mechanics. Composed demeanor. Fantastic hair. For a rookie, Ponder looks every bit a future superstar. In his first two starts, the first-round pick played about as well as anyone could expect. He completed 52.7-percent of his attempts for 227.5 yards per game while notching a 3:2 td:int split, an effort, as Visanthe Shiancoe remarked to the Star-Tribune last week, that sparked a team-wide culture change. If Donovan McNabb was Debbie Downer, Ponder is Peppy Pete. The youngster's cool-under-pressure mentality has rubbed off on the entire locker-room, providing players with a renewed sense of confidence. Under the prime-time lights Monday, the unfazed passer, who tallied 22 standard league points Week 7 against the Pack, could be even better in the rematch. Green Bay's defense, particularly against the pass, has been very suspect this season. Through eight games the Cheeseheads have given up a mind-blowing 315.6 passing yards and 2.0 passing touchdowns per game, equal to the second-most fantasy points allowed to QBs. Only Matt Ryan and Sam Bradford in Weeks 5 and 6 failed to surpass the 20-point mark against them. Yes, Lambeau Field can be an intimidating place for any quarterback, but Ponder's unflinching attitude combined with the Packers' inefficiencies on defense and the Vikes' play-from-behind potential suggest this is the week he could reach sensation status alongside fellow rookies Cam Newton and Andy Dalton. Sound the horn."

S"McGahee is to fantasy running backs what Jennifer Connelly is to the realm of hotness, horrifically underrated. Running as though Nevin Shapiro was trying to chase him down with $100 bills gripped between his fingers, the 30-year-old throttled the Raiders totaling 168 yards and two touchdowns, his fourth 100-yard effort in eight games. Take away his uneventful Week 1 (35 total yards, 0 tds), and the 'U' product has averaged a rock solid 14.6 points per game, a mark that ranks 10th overall among RBs, one spot ahead of Mr. Century Mark, Frank Gore. Given his advanced age, it's truly amazing what McGahee has accomplished. Don't think it's a fluke. With Tim Tebow under center, John Fox has turned back the clock, emphasizing the run at a 54.8-percent clip over the past three weeks. He's even leaned on the read option, a play rarely seen on the professional level. Oakland, bewildered often last week, couldn't solve it. This week, Kansas City may also struggle figuring it out. The Chiefs have only surrendered one 100-yard rusher this year (Fred Jackson Week 1), but Ryan Mathews, Michael Bush and, of all people, Reggie Bush each flirted with triple-digits against them. Overall, they've yielded the seventh-most fantasy points to RBs. In a revamped Broncos offense, McGahee should again be McGood on the road."

S'The true headquarters of ground and pound isn\'t in New York. It\'s actually located in Houston. With Andre Johnson slowly mending from a hamstring injury, Arian Foster and Ben Tate, on pace to become the seventh 1,000-yard duo in NFL history, are routinely pulverizing opponents into dust. Though the former is the clear bell cow, the latter, too, has mooed in limited doses. Tate, who\'s averaged an insane 8.2 yards per carry over his past 27 totes, runs as though someone just kicked his dog. He\'s an extremely physical back with great speed and a terrific initial step, vital attributes in Gary Kubiak\'s one-cut-and-go system. As the Piano Man crooned Monday, if not for Foster, Tate, similar to Michael Bush, would be a sure-fire RB1. His tremendous skill set combined with Houston\'s dominating offensive line are a match made in fantasy heaven. Expect Tate, and Foster, to pay a divine reward this week in Tampa. The Bucs, who last week lost their best run defender, Gerald McCoy, to a season-ending biceps tear, are very vulnerable up front. Even with the hole-plunger on the field, they conceded 4.9 yards per carry, 118.8 rushing yards per game and eight touchdowns to rushers, equal to the fourth-most fantasy points allowed. Tate, who playfully reminds Foster after every big run "I\'m coming after you," is very trustworthy despite an expected 10-12 carry workload. Play the second fiddle.'

S"With Miles Austin on the shelf for the next 2-4 weeks nursing a hamstring injury, the under-the-radar backup could soon bask in statistical stardom. Robinson, a plus-sized receiver with stellar downfield speed (16.1 yards per catch), has come on of late, even with Austin in uniform. Targeted 13 times by Tony Romo since Week 8, he's hauled in 10 catches for 135 yards and two touchdowns. As Jason Garrett noted earlier this week the wideout is a playmaker who's consistently made contested catches, providing a noticeable spark for a team that's occasionally struggled in vertical execution. Yes, Buffalo may lead the AFC in interceptions, but it's nowhere close to an unfriendly matchup for receiver purposes. On the year, the Bills have allowed the ninth-most 20-yard pass plays and seven 75-yard WR performances. Corner Drayton Florence, Robinson's likely shadow, has given up a very generous 15.5 yards per catch. Add. Start. Reap. Dallas' new WR2 is about to become must-start material."

S"Well-endowed numbers could be in the offing for Breaston. Before Week 7's battle in the Black Hole, the Chiefs' No. 2, after a fairly slow start, expressed he and Matt Cassel were finally on the same page. Since that admission, the pair have connected 12 times (on 24 targets) for 241 yards, including a season-best 115 yards last week in a blowout loss to Miami. The tandem should continue to carry momentum over this week against Denver. The Broncos, even with Champ Bailey back, continue to give up a ton of fantasy points through the air. In fact, they've allowed the most fantasy points to WRs on the season. With Andre Goodman, who Pro Football Focus ranks as the 97th-best cover corner in the league, expected to draw Breaston, the receiver has strong odds of finishing well-inside the position's top-30 for the second consecutive week. Keep in mind No. 2s are averaging a healthy 61.6 yards per game against the Mile High Messiahs this year. Play motorboat."

S"Save for Maurice Jones-Drew, Jaguars have corrupted fantasy lineups more than Silvio Berlusconi has Italian bank accounts, and floozies. Jacksonville, for the most part, is a statistical wasteland. However, Hill could an oasis of production this week. Why? The Colts, specifically corner Jacob Lacey, are just that bad. QBs have completed 73.5-percent of their passes to the rookie CB's side. Hill, who's averaged a healthy 16.1 yards per catch, has a great shot of burning Lacey deep, possibly more than once. On the year, Indy has allowed the sixth-most 20-plus yard pass plays. And, overall, wide receivers are performing 26.5-percent above the league average against it. Because Blaine Gabbert is under center, any Jags WR is a bit risky, but the friendly matchup could make Hill, who has splashed pay-dirt in three of his past four games, plenty relevant even in 12-team leagues. Count on him as a WR3 or FLEX option, deep thinkers."

S'Dampened probably best describes Brady\'s mood over the past several weeks. After lighting the world on fire over the first three weeks of the season, he\'s merely flickered since, averaging a very \'06-like 21.5 standard points per game. That\'s still QB1 worthy in 12-teamers, but far from the ridiculous numbers owners have become accustomed to. So what\'s ailing Tom Terrific? As Karen Guregian from the Boston Globe detailed earlier this week, several factors are negatively impacting the two-time MVP. For starters, pass protection has broken down, forcing Mr. Bundchen into misreads and hurries. Second, he isn\'t finding his second/third options as efficiently, likely due to increased man coverage. Third, outside Wes Welker and Rob Gronkowski, the passer has "trust issues" with his targets. Deion Branch\'s disappearing act and Chad Ochocinco\'s "stanko" side are partly to blame, but so is Brady. Finally, in many cases he\'s held onto the ball too long, becoming a human tackling dummy for blitzing defenders. Brady has posted 20 points-plus in three consecutive games against the Jets. But with Darrelle Revis expected to shadow Welker in the slot the entire game, it could be tough sledding for No. 12. Signal callers have completed just 33.3 percent of their attempts to "The Island\'s" side. Also, keep in mind the Jets have surrendered just one multi-TD passer this season (Tony Romo in Week 1) and the fewest fantasy points to QBs on the year, allowing just five passing touchdowns to 13 interceptions. It may seem Edward Norton in "Fight Club" crazy to lean on an alternative, but fantasy is a game of matchup exploitation.'

S'Is Beanie unhealthy? Was Heavy D the greatest "phat" rapper of all-time (Sidebar: Possibly no person has incorporated hunky dory so beautifully into a song than the "Overweight Lover")? Wells is obviously ailing. Bothered by a knee injury suffered against Pittsburgh on October 23, he has not showed the off-tackle explosion exhibited earlier this season. As Ken Whisenhunt disclosed after last week\'s OT win against St. Louis, his bell cow, "hasn\'t been able to run outside for a few weeks now." Without a doubt Philadelphia is a sieve against the run. Overall, the Eagles have yielded 5.4 yards per carry, 118.9 rushing yards per game and eight total touchdowns to RBs this year, equal to the fifth-most fantasy points allowed. Only Washington\'s generally inept ground attack laid an egg against them. However, with John Skelton under center and given Beanie\'s current physical state, he\'s a volatile commodity who will likely underwhelm. The early blowout potential also supports that perspective. Coming off a horrific 10-20-0 effort against the Lambs, Beanie is benchable in shallow formats.'

S"The Pocket Rocket, one of the surprise sensations of the 2011 season, has taken bargain shoppers to infinity and beyond. The man, despite a modest workload, has averaged better than a point per touch this season (1.03). And, for the PPR zealots in attendance, he's caught at least five balls in every game this year. He and Jimmy Graham are the first RB/TE combo to each have 50 catches over the regular season's first nine weeks. Good things do indeed come in small packages. Though never worthy of a demotion in PPR formats, he is a player to consider benching in standard leagues. Atlanta, specifically linebacker Sean Weatherspoon, has defended the run brilliantly for much of the season, especially over the past five weeks. During that span, backs are performing 38.6-percent below the league average against it. Obviously, Sproles isn't a between-the-tackles grinder, but the Falcons have done a fairly good job bottling up versatile RBs. Throw in the expected split with Pierre Thomas, Christopher Ivory and possibly Mark Ingram, who returned to practice Wednesday, and Sproles is a bit riskier than normal. Week 10 could be his fourth sub-10-point effort in his past five."

Corners Carlos Rogers and sporadically used Chris Colliver each rank inside the top-10 in coverage according to Pro Football Focus. Against the pair, receivers are averaging a mere 10.1 yards per catch. Super Mario's Warrior side, which presumably was buried weeks ago, could again make a guest appearance. Top targets have done their damage against the Niners, but No. 2s certainly haven't, averaging just 37.9 yards per game. Over the past two weeks Manningham has hauled in nine receptions for 96 yards and two touchdowns (on 16 targets), but with Victor Cruz's offensive role growing, odds are strong Mario will take a backseat, even if Hakeem Nicks, who didn't practice Wednesday, sits out another week. Under that scenario, Rogers would likely be assigned to Mario, an unwanted matchup. Press the pause button."

S"If Lloyd registers WR1 or even mid-level WR2 numbers against one of the league's finest cover corners, Joe Haden, The Noise is with Bieber. Lock-down Brown, the third-best CB in the league according to Pro Football Focus, leads the league in passes defended and has conceded just 19 receptions on 41 attempts (46.3 completion percentage). Overall, only Michael Crabtree and A.J. Green have surpassed the 10-point threshold against Cleveland this season. Lloyd, though having a down year compared to 2010's breakout campaign, is a wonderfully skilled player with an attractive workload. Since joining the Rams he's averaged 12.7 targets per game. But, as the Post-Dispatch noted earlier this week, Sam Bradford hasn't found his touch with the deep-ball, overthrowing Lloyd on what would have been a couple of easy TDs last week. In fact, Bradford has completed just 18-of-70 attempts above 20 yards in his young career. Considering the passer's shortcomings downfield and the wideout's date with Haden, he is a mid-level WR3 at best this week in 12-team formats."

With the multipurpose rusher in street clothes, Bruce Arians will install a Johnson & Johnson backfield, a Band-Aid that will barely stop the bleeding, even in an attractive matchup against the Bears. Suffice it to say, Palmer better do an extra curl or two in the gym this week. Hosting the Saints Week 1, the veteran was brilliant. Though Michael Floyd played zero factor in his return to action, the Red Baron dropped bombs on the New Orleans secondary. He completed 19-of-32 attempts for 307 yards and three scores. His resulting 11.8 aDOT (average depth of target), topped only by Ryan Fitzpatrick (12.7) and Ben Roethlisberger (12.2), was off the charts. Most importantly, he was placed under pressure on just 24.3 percent of his dropbacks. Give Palmer time in 'Zona's no-huddle and he'll slice and dice defenses, including Chicago's. Aaron Rodgers tallied a modest 189 pass yards against the Bears last week, but found the end-zone three times and completed 78.3 percent of his attempts. Corners Alan Ball and Kyle Fuller, who ranked No. 69 and No. 79 respectively in coverage Week 1 according to Pro Football Focus, will be picked on. The 17th-highest QB on the Yahoo DFS board, he's one of the better bargains at the position."

S"Regurgitated sloppy Joes. That's what Sankey looked like his rookie season. But ignoring the superficial numbers, the Washington product was an effective back under the surface. He ranked No. 10 among RBs in elusive rating and posted a very laudable 66.4 yards after contact percentage. However, his No. 42 final positional standing squashed any positive thoughts. As a result, he slipped into the double-digit rounds of most 2016 drafts. Those who paid the low cover charge may end up dancing the season away. Sankey was sensational Week 1 against Tampa. His 0.95 fantasy points per opportunity ranked No. 1 among RBs. Overall, he totaled 86 yards, scored twice and gained 56 of his 72 rush yards after contact. Terrance West only had one fewer touch (13 vs. 14), but Sankey was clearly the more effective back. A committee approach will continue this week in Cleveland. Still, the sophomore rusher is a recommended start/buy in all formats. The Chihuahuas, who ranked dead last defending the run in 2014, picked up where they left off, conceding 91 rush yards and a pair of scores to Chris Ivory last Sunday. Overall, Jets backs averaged 4.56 yards per carry. If Marcus Mariota continues to shine, Sankey will again crack the RB top-20 with relative ease. At a penny-pinching $16 in Yahoo DFS, he's the definition of 'bargain basement buy.' Load up. "

S"For those are already labeling C.J. Anderson 'Montee Ball 2.0,' relax. Sure the rusher swam backstrokes in a cesspool Week 1, but the unfriendly matchup (vs. Bal) and toe injury he suffered mid-game certainly limited him. When healthy, he's the best all-around RB on roster. However, because of the short week, it's entirely possible Gary Kubiak will hold back his young rusher. That happens, and Hillman could slash and dash his way to a very profitable evening. Recall Ronnie was very impressive in a full-time role from Weeks 7-12 last year (81. 5 yards per game, 4 TDs, RB12). It seems plausible he will tote the heavy side of the committee Thursday night. Last week he saw only 17 snaps against Baltimore, but accounted for 41 yards on 12 carries, an output highlighted by a pair of clutch fourth-quarter runs. With or without CJA, he should generate at least 15 touches Thursday night. On most occasions, Arrowhead is rather unwelcoming. However, the Chiefs did surrender 4.6 yards per carry to a Houston backfield spearheaded by vanilla sophomore Alfred Blue last Sunday. If the Denver offensive line, which ranked No. 10 in run-blocking Week 1 according to PFF, can muster consistent push, Hillman will crack the RB top-20. After last week, Kubiak will want to alleviate pressure on a fading Peyton Manning. Admittedly, Hilliman is a flier, but there's a ton of profit potential here in all formats. "

S"When Smith entered the league roughly 1,368 years ago, most people believed Chris Berman was still cool. The receiver has certainly been around the block. Unlike previous seasons, the old codger didn't sprint out of the gate Week 1. Against arguably the league's nastiest secondary, Denver, he was bottled up catching just two passes (on six targets) for 13 yards. However, a quick turnaround is on the horizon. This is Marc Trestman's supposed high-flying offense after all and the matchup is awfully attractive. Last Sunday against visiting Cincinnati, the Raiders once again resembled the bumbling marauders we've grown accustomed to seeing. Manhandled in all facets, they surrendered nearly 400 yards of total offense and 6.1 yards per gain. Most damning, they lost starting safeties Charles Woodson (shoulder) and Nate Allen (knee) to significant injuries. Larry Asante, who allowed a 118.8 QB rating to his assignments last Sunday, and rookie Keenan Lambert will now have the daunting task of grounding the Ravens. And don't expect the pair to get much assistance. DB D.J. Hayden ranked dead last in pass coverage among Week 1 corners per PFF. Put it all together and  Senior Smith should be Flacco's go-to option, possibly enticing 10-plus targets. "

S"Welcome to fantasy relevancy, Mr. Moncrief. Colts Pro Bowl selection T.Y. Hilton banged his knee in the opener at Buffalo. Diagnosed with a deep bruise, he was originally expected to miss multiple games. The team, however, officially designated him 'day-to-day' on Monday, an incredibly vague timetable. Just ask those who freaked out about Alshon Jeffery in August. Assuming Hilton is unavailable, the second-year Ole Miss product is a highly employable WR3 in 12-team and deeper leagues and a superb low-cost DFS buy. One of my favorite WR prospects from last year's draft. he possesses the size, long speed and separation skills necessary to reap much success. His 6-46-1 line last week in Buffalo was just a preview. With the exception of a 54-yard Johnny Manziel-to-Travis Benjamin connection, the Jets secondary played well in its opener, Darrelle Revis and Marcus Williams in particular. But if Revis primarily shadows Andre Johnson, Moncrief could be Andrew Luck's money man. Again, if Hilton is sidelined, the wideout could meet or exceed the 11 targets he totaled in Week 1. Keep in mind, New York's D is run stiff. You simply can't lose at $13. "

S"Dez Bryant's foot ailment was an anvil-drop to the crotch. His projected 4-8 week absence is a massive blow to the Cowboys and fantasy rosters. But the show must go on. Many believe Terrance Williams is destined for the biggest uptick in value. Though somewhat improved, the WR doesn't have enough branches on the route tree to fill Dez's enormous shoes. I'm convinced Tony Romo will spread the love between Williams, Cole Beasley, Jason Witten, Lance Dunbar and Escobar. The oversized target, deployed almost exclusively inside the red zone (20 career catches, seven touchdowns), may see more action between the 20s in two-TE sets. He won't be a high-volume weapon, but at 6-foot-6, 260-pounds and equipped with adequate speed, he may see 5-7 targets per game moving forward. That could certainly be the case given the shootout potential in Philly (55.5 Vegas over/under). The Eagles' uptempo offense almost always press teams to chuck it. If you're in the market for a discount TE, Escobar is your guy. "

S"Nearly impeccable in the Pats' opener versus Pittsburgh (25-32, 288-4-0), Tom Terrific will give way to creepy courtroom-sketch Brady, an alter-ego fit for a DirecTV ad, not a DFS roster, especially at a pricey $45. Over his lengthy career, the reigning World Champ has consumed several Buffalo burgers. In 26 games, he averaged 240.7 passing yards and 2.2 passing touchdowns per game, throwing just 19 total picks against the division rival. His most recent visit to Wing City, Week 6 last year, he tallied 361 yards and four scores. However, 2015's Bills are a different defensive breed. Under mastermind Rex Ryan, they're attacking, unyielding and downright impenetrable at times. Last week, they held projected QB king Andrew Luck to a modest 243-2-2-20 output and a wretched 4.96 pass yards per attempt. Specifically, Stephon Gilmore, who wants a piece of Rob Gronkowski Sunday, stifled his assignments. Thrown at 15 times, he surrendered seven receptions (46.7 catch percentage) and deflected four passes. Having LeGarrette Blount back helps, but If Gilmore, Ronald Darby and Mario Butler continue to play at a high level, New England's golden boy will resemble fantasy pyrite. Don't chase Week 1's numbers. "

S"Everyone's favorite rotund rusher, as expected, devoured the Bears last week en route to 99 total yards and a score. Per usual, he plowed through would-be tacklers gaining 56.4 percent of his yards after initial contact. An underrated receiver, he also hauled in two Aaron Rodgers passes for 12 yards. However, after being blessed with the mother of all matchups Week 1, Lacy will have to answer to daddy Sunday night. The Seahawks stamped out the run relentlessly last year, especially when matched against Green Bay. In a pair of 2014 games, including the playoffs, Lacy totaled an unexciting 3.24 yards per carry, 118 combined yards and zero touchdowns against Seattle. He'll receive his customary 18-22 touch workload, but a nauseating amount of 3-yard plods could be on tap. Benny Cunningham is no Lacy, but he accounted for only 2.8 yards per carry on 16 totes against the 'Hawks a week ago. The elevated backup did chip in four catches for 77 yards, but the Packer backer is largely used as a dump off option in the pass game, which limits his scoring potential. Bruce Irvin, K.J. Wright and Bobby Wagner were very active containing the run Week 1. This week against a stiffer foe, I anticipate the trio to be even better. "

S'It seems for the better part of the last half century, silver-tongued scribes have attempted to predict Gore\'s demise. But every year the consistency king left them with egg on their face. All good things eventually do come to an end, however, and that could be the case for the 32-year-old rusher this season. The future AARP spokesman looked every bit his age last week in Buffalo. He broke few tackles, slumped his way to 31 yards on eight carries and, most concerning, saw action on just 33 of 77 snaps. Game flow was partially to blame as the Colts fell behind early, but the limited workload certainly raised eyebrows, particularly after Chuck Pagano\'s "pitch count" comments leading up to Week 1. Gore should grip the rock more often Monday Night, possibly reaching 15 total touches, but an unsightly final line is a likely outcome. New York dominated Cleveland in the trenches last Sunday. The Browns, who were supposed to have a top-10 offensive line, were tossed around like rag-dolls. In all, Isaiah Crowell and company totaled a ghastly 2.3 yards per carry. Indy, remarkably, did rank top-12 in run-blocking Week 1. Still, the matchup isn\'t conducive for a favorable fantasy result. '

S"As stated time and time again across various media platforms, Steve Smith was not a recommended option in Week 1. Why? Two words: Chris Harris. The Denver corner is the best pass defender in the game today. Yes, better than Darrelle Revis or Richard Sherman. He ranked No. 1 in coverage last year according to Pro Football Focus, surrendering a 47.4 QB rating. More impressively, he hasn't allowed a touchdown in 17 straight games. He's as close to 'shutdown' as it gets. No surprise, he and Aqib Talib squeezed Smith Sr., holding him to a mere two receptions for 13 yards. And that was without starting safety T.J. Ward, one of the hardest hitting DBs in the league. With Ward back in the mix, the heat will most certainly be on Alex Smith's top wide receiver Thursday night. Thoughts of him even repeating last week's largely vanilla 5-52-0 line is a 'shroom-induced illusion. Toss in Denver's dogged pass rush and Maclin is 100 percent avoidable. Give me Donte Moncrief (vs. NYJ), Kendall Wright (at Cle) or John Brown (at Chi) over him. "

S"So much for Blake Bortles being a competent NFL quarterback. Against a much-improved Carolina Panthers defense it was the same tired story for the Jags \xe2\x80\x93 persistent ineffectiveness, rare red-zone looks, bed wettings. SO Jacksonville. In total, the Hello Kitties of the AFC scraped together a horrendous 265 yards of total offense. Worse, they ran eight (out of 66) plays inside the 20. Recall a season ago, they registered a league-worst 8.5 red-zone percentage. Robinson, hyped throughout the preseason for his spectacular end-zone grabs and projected heightened role, caught just one pass (on six targets) for 27 yards. Predictably, investors who shelled out an early-round pick for the WR's services are now very nervous. Another stinker, and a pants change will be needed. If you're an owner, it's wise to pick up another pair of Dungarees. Kirk Cousins is by no means a world-beater, but the Dolphins clamped down on Washington's pass attack last week. Overall, 'Skins WRs caught only 11 balls for 125 yards. Corners Brent Grimes and Brice McCain, deservedly, ranked No. 15 and No. 19 in pass coverage Week 1 per PFF. Unless Bortles morphs into late-90s Mark Brunell, Robinson will underachieve again. "

S"Not long in the past, Buffalo's collection of allegedly shoddy quarterbacks was worth approximately one Zimbabwean Dollar. No fantasy investor was willing to shell out a penny for any of them. However, thanks to Taylor's profitable start, many are now debating whether he's worth a weekly nod over high-priced options Andrew Luck, Russell Wilson or Peyton Manning. How quickly views can change. Through three weeks, the Bill has trampled the competition. He's tossed accurate darts (74.4 completion percentage), often deflected intense pressure, made plays with his legs, taken shots downfield (9.15 yards per attempt) and, most importantly for virtual game purposes, has routinely found the end zone. Against AFC foes Indy, New England and Miami he totaled 270 combined yards per game and tallied an 8:3 TD:INT split (1 rush TD), an output good enough for a top-five ranking at QB. We're indeed living in a Bizarro World. At this rate, Screech will soon seal the deal with Lisa Turtle. Tyrod's unpredictable run should continue this week against the visiting Giants. Thus far, New York has given up a 300-yard passer each week along with 7.39 pass yards per attempt. Digging deeper, Prince Amukamura has performed well ranking top-20 in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus and Doiminique Rodgers-Cromartie should return from a one-week absence due to a concussion, but the secondary remains vulnerable. DRC, Jayron Hosley and Trumaine McBride have surrendered a combined 72.7 catch percentage. With or without Sammy Watkins, the Taylor windfall should continue. "

S"Though active Week 3 against the Eagles, Ivory served up believers with a string of donuts. And he didn't even garnish them with rainbow sprinkles. Many will have difficulties washing away the bitter taste, but the Jets rusher should get back to his tattooing ways across the pond. When on the the field this season, Ivory has been the mid-range RB2 some projected. Though replaced at times by Bilal Powell, he's levied the boom on early downs (64.8 YAC%), forced missed tackles on 20.6 percent of his attempts, operated as the primary goal-line option and, almost inexplicably, caught the occasional pass. Given the scorched-earth landscape at RB, he is a reliable 15-20 touch per game option in 12-team leagues, when healthy. The Dolphins defense, seemingly trapped in a fishing net, has drowned in misery, a completely unexpected outcome with Ndamukong Suh manning the trenches. They have allowed a modest 4.01 yards per carry to RBs, but, as Karlos Williams proved last week, this is a unit that can be humbled in a hurry. The Bills and Redskins (Week1) had much success on the ground against it. Pay close attention to Ivory's practice reports this week, but the extended layoff should do him wonders. In the Land of Lavishly Treated Welsh Corgis, New York's 'Ripper' shreds Miami. (In London)"

S"For Jeremy Hill enthusiasts, the sky is indeed falling. Blame sophomore slumps. Blame the Super Blood Moon. Blame balding supposed fantasy 'gurus' who told he was a safe RB1. Whatever the reason, Hill is free-falling, a tailspin that's suddenly boosted the value of his overlooked compatriot. Right now, Bernard is the most trusted back in Cincy. And he should be. The third-year man from North Carolina has secured the ball, forced more missed tackles (15), been more effective in the pass game and, shockingly, has gained more yards after contact (55.7 YAC%) compared to Hill (51.7). Last week against Baltimore, he nearly doubled his teammate's snap count, seeing action 66.2 percent of the time. Unless Hill sniffs smelling salts, that script will remain unchanged this week against Kansas City, despite Hue Jackson's claim the LSU product continues to be the starter. Evidenced in Aaron Rodgers' 5-TD undressing of KC last Monday, its weakness is clearly defending the pass. With that in mind, it's highly likely Andy Dalton and friends move the ball at will vertically, possibly setting up Gio with several goal-to-go situations. Currently the more sure-handed and trusted option inside the red-zone Bernard should handle the rock near the pylons. Keep in mind, he has five more totes inside the 20 since Week 2 compared to Hill. Count on him as a top-20 RB. "

S"It seems as though Tim Brown is masquerading as Crabtree. It's the only reasonable explanation for why the very average receiver has exceeded expectations. In all seriousness, Derek Carr and Amari Cooper deserve major props. The rockin' AC/DC combination has gifted the former Niner with soft, single coverage, situations which he's used to his advantage. On a weighty 32 targets, equal to Brandon Marshall's looks, Crabtree has caught 18 passes for 184 yards and a touchdown. His subsequent 24.4 fantasy points ranks top-36 among WRs, firmly placing the Raider within the WR3 conversation on a week-in, week-out basis. This Sunday, however, he may jump a full tier. Putting it mildly, the Boo-Boo Bears of Chicago are once again an embarrassment defensively. They've surrendered the sixth-most fantasy points to WRs, including a TD hat-trick to Larry Fitzgerald in Week 2. Unbelievably, corners Sherrick McManis, Kyle Fuller and Alan Ball have allowed a 132.6 QB rating and 77.1 catch percentage to their assignments. What remarkable generosity. Similar to what he achieved Week 2 versus Baltimore, Crabtree has a reasonable shot at 100 yards and a score. Throw dollars at him, and any other Raider, all day long. "

S"The veteran's resurrection has been nothing short of amazing. Arguably, THE surprise sensation of the early season, he's transformed from garbage to gold virtually overnight, regaining his top-20 form from 2012. Through three games, Jones and Rodgers have forged an unbreakable bond, particularly near the end zone. He's seen just 15 targets, but the receiver caught 12 of them for 219 yards and four touchdowns, the eighth-best line at WR. His current 64-1168-21 pace is Randy Moss-esque. At some point, he should regress to the mean, but don't anticipate a lapse in Week 4. The Niners' have mined nothing but fossilized dung thus far. Established quarterbacks have blitzed them repeatedly thus far. Ben Roethsliberger and Carson Palmer each compiled 300-plus yard, multi-TD performances against them, totaling an absurd 11.5 pass yards per attempt. Under the microscope, San Fran corners Tramine Brock and Kenneth Acker, who rank outside the top-70 in pass coverage according to Pro Football focus, have yielded a combined 71.4 catch percentage and 14.5 yards per catch. With Davante Adams a probable injury casualty (ankle) and attention focused on Randall Cobb, Jones' comeback story adds another page. "

S"The NFL might be the most environmentally conscious professional sports league around. Quarterbacks, previously thought to be washed up and un-renewable, are constantly recycled. Just look at Matt Schaub and Matt Cassel. How either still collects a check is beyond human comprehension. Vick, unlike the clumsy Matts, is a competent, roster worthy QB. Admittedly, the last time he was under center full time with the New York Jets, the veteran was a complete (expletive) show. In three starts, he completed just 58.4 percent of his attempts, tallied 155 combined yards per game and totaled three virtually meaningless touchdowns. At 35, he's no spring chicken and the short week to prepare is a concern, but he's an upside stopgap for ailing Ben Roethlisberger/Tony Romo owners and Tom Brady/Marcus Mariota zealots in the market for a useful one-week filler. Keep in mind, the Steelers offensive line currently rates No. 1 in pass-blocking per PFF, Vick can still scramble with the best of them and has arguably the best 1-2 punch in the league, Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell, to spoon feed. The matchup isn't too shabby either. More featherless Tweety Birds than fearsome Ravens, this year's Baltimore defense has been a pushover. Jimmy Smith and LaDarius Webb have surrendered 15.3 yards per catch to their assignments. As a unit, the AFC North foe has given up a healthy 7.45 pass yards per attempt and the second-most fantasy points to signal callers. Yes, #TequilaThursday is warranted for a reason. The quality of play on TNF typically encourages imbibing. But gut says Vick will be serviceable in a pinch, especially in Todd Haley's offense."

S"Cincinnati's matchup with the arrow-less Chiefs should be akin to a classic episode of 'Oprah's Favorite Things.' EVERYONE scores a touchdown. Hill, however, will be the lone exception. You may not believe in vampires, leprechauns, Chupacabra or other urban legends, but sophomore slumps are all too real. Last year, Keenan Allen and Zac Stacy were afflicted leaving broken hearts and busted dreams in their wake. Now, it appears Hill is bearing the curse. A runaway beer truck last year, the rookie is riding on spare tires in the encore. His electric effort last fall was expected to relegate Gio Bernard to mop-up duty, but the table has turned. Hill, beleaguered by fumbles, has looked sluggish, powerless and generally rancid. Through three games, Bernard has dwarfed him in yards per carry, yards after contact and missed tackles percentage. Game flow is partially responsible for the recent snap gap, but unless Hill wakes up soon, his tag-team partner may continue to steal the headlines. KC does present a unique opportunity. Due to the Chiefs' wretched pass defense Cincy should knock at the door early and often. But it could be Bernard, who has nearly double the red-zone touches over the past two weeks, who secures the scoring spotlight. And keep in mind, for as repulsive KC has been in pass D, it's been excellent versus the run giving up just 3.54 yards per carry. Hill will likely draw the start, but that doesn't mean he should for your squad. Give me Devonta Freeman (vs. Hou), Karlos Williams (vs. NYG) and Ryan Mathews (at Was) over him. "

S"Scientists have found water on Mars yet Forsett has yet to find the end-zone or logged a 100-yard game. What is going on in the universe?! Though he's been the preferred carrier in Baltimore's backfield (17.0 touches per game), last year's waiver gem has failed to deliver even serviceable numbers. Against Denver, Oakland and Cincy, he averaged a pedestrian 55.0 total yards per game without a score. Most alarming, his 3.2 yards per carry is a far cry from the 5.2 yards per tote he logged last year. Suffice it to say, the transition from Gary Kubiak to Marc Trestmen hasn't been palatable. On the periphery, Forsett remains one of the league leaders in breakaway percentage and hasn't seen a significant drop-off in other measurements, which bodes well for a turnaround. However, the Ravens' No. 26 rank in run-blocking combined with their forgiving defense and Lorenzo Taliaferro's role at the goal-line have greatly hindered the rusher. Better days lay ahead, but don't expect a rebound in Week 4. Pittsburgh's defense, despite its youth, has collapsed on rushers quickly. It's given up only 2.87 yards per carry and the fewest fantasy points to RBs. Carlos Hyde, off his libido-driving Week 1, was held to just 61 combined yards Week 2 against the Iron Forgers before leaving with an injury in the second half. Throw in the short week, and Forsett is bench-worthy in shallow formats, even if Ryan Shazier, PFF's top-rated inside linebacker versus the run, isn't available. "

S'Let\'s be real for a moment. Some unspecified fantasy sites out there have anointed Yeldon the second-coming. They\'ll tell you ad nauseum his laborious workload and three-down skill set will be worth the wait. For those that believe the rookie will develop into a reliable, weekly RB2, by all means sell all your worldly possessions, find the nearest hill and wait for His Holiness to descend from the heavens. It\'s bound to happen right? In reality, T.J. stands for "Total Junk." At this point in his career, he\'s a snake-oil salesmen in a football uniform. Though impressively built at 6-foot-1, 225-pounds, Yeldon runs with the conviction of a timid penguin. He does own adequate hands, but he\'s unassertive between the tackles and underwhelms after contact. His 3.2 yards per carry and 1.8 yards after contact per attempt rank as one of the league\'s lowest among rushers with at least 80 snaps. And he\'s operated behind the 10th-best run-blocking unit according to Pro Football Focus. To be fair, game flow has not been his friend, but the proof is in the pudding. He\'s average. Indy has allowed the 10th-most fantasy points to RBs this season, but only 3.54 yards per carry. In a contest that has the potential to get lopsided in a hurry (Vegas line: Indy -9), Yeldon is entirely avoidable. That\'s quite the statement considering the sparse options currently at RB.  Go Lance Dunbar (at NO), Matt Jones (vs. Phi) or Darren Sproles (at Was) instead. '

S"More atoll than island Week 1 against Cleveland, a game in which he conceded seven receptions on nine targets, Darrelle Revis has regained his shutdown form since yielding just one reception on six targets. Overall, he's given up a remarkable 44.2 QB rating to his assignments, the fifth-lowest among CBs with at least 120 snaps. Landry is Miami's version of Julian Edelman. Instead of consuming large meals in one sitting he grazes on the competition, evidenced in his 9.6 yards per catch. He does have the most goal-line targets (4) of any WR in the league, an output which speaks to the preseason claim of his red-zone preeminence. Favorably, he's also snagged eight receptions (on 11.3 targets per game) in each of his first three contests. In other words, the slot man is a PPR mainstay. But similar to what Jordan Matthews experienced last week versus New York (6-49-0), he will sit his tush under a palm tree. Collectively, the Jets have allowed the ninth-fewest fantasy points to wide receivers. Ryan Tannehill will attempt to force feed him, but given the Revis factor I suspect the QB will pick on underachiever Antonio Cromartie with Rishard Matthews or rising rookie DaVante Parker.

S"Since his pair of Popeye punches Week 1, Kelce's spinach power has waned. Point the finger at the oversized blood clot, Andy Reid. It's inexplicable a player of Kelce's caliber has only seen 21 total targets. Jason Witten and Jordan Reed have enticed more looks. Simply put, he should be lined up in the crosshairs at least nine times per game. His physicality, long-range speed, polished routes and reliable hands make him one of the game's premier vertical weapons. Through three games he's forced a position-high six missed tackles and gained a handsome 9.1 yards after catch per reception. GET HIM THE DAMN BALL! Despite my roisterous pleas \xe2\x80\x93 I'm not at all bitter \xe2\x80\x93  it's entirely predictable Kelce will again under-perform. Cincinnati hasn't faced a murderer's row at TE this season. LaDarius Green and Crockett Gillmore were the toughest opponents they've battled. However, they limited the pair to a combined 87 yards on eight receptions. As a whole, the Bengals have allowed a mere 6.77 pass yards per attempt. Vincent Rey and Rey Maualuga will have their hands full, but in a raucous road environment, I suspect Kelce will register dullish numbers. "

S"'Tango and Cash.' 'Turner and Hooch.' 'Thelma and Louise ...' The next great buddy movie headed for the big screen might just be 'Quintorris and Ice.' Julio Jones and Ryan have been nearly inseparable to start the season. Only the Ben Roethilsberger-to-Antonio Brown combo has proven deadlier. Through two games, the pair have connected 22 times for 276 yards and two touchdowns. However, that production was generated against two forgiving defenses, Philly and New York. As we've seen thus far, Dallas is an entirely different defensive animal. After losing top cover corner Orlando Scandrick to an ACL/MCL, most predicted doom and gloom in Big D. Sadly, it's the offense, which has already lost Tony Romo and Dez Bryant, that's stepped foot into a post-apocalyptic world. DC Rod Marinelli has done wonders. He's ratcheted up pressure, forced numerous turnovers and halted drives. Collectively, the Cowboys have given up a mere 5.71 pass yards per attempt, one passing touchdown and the second-fewest fantasy points to QBs. Starting corners Morris Claiborne and Brandon Carr have surrendered only 7.5 yards per catch to their assignments. Julio, when healthy, is practically invincible, but if the Dallas secondary clamps down in similar fashion as they did Odell Beckham Jr. Week 1 (8-5-44-0), it will be a very vanilla day for Ryan. "

S"Revenge is a dish best served ... perfectly cooked. Against his former employer last Sunday, Murray succumbed to one backfield drag-down after another. Chip Kelly's surprisingly lack of creativity combined with Philly's shoddy offensive line had the high-priced rusher's pants around his ankles. Including that deplorable performance, 10 of his first 21 rush attempts of the season have gone for 1, zero or negative yards. His 11 total rush yards are equal to Rex Burkhead ... errr ... Andy Dalton. Equally concerning, he's occasionally surrendered playing time to Darren Sproles and Ryan Mathews seeing just 57.4 percent of the Eagles snaps. If not for a pair of touchdowns Week 1, we would be talking about arguably the worst start by a reigning fantasy RB king in the virtual game's history. And don't expect a quick turnaround. The road to respectability gets tougher for Murray. Pizza rat probably couldn't find a crease in New York's ironclad defensive line. The Jets have yielded just 2.88 yards per carry to RBs thus far. Linebacker David Harris has already accounted for eight stops, the third-most at his position. Suffice it to say, Todd Bowels' teachings, which made Arizona one of the most cast-iron run Ds in the league under his direction, have taken hold. Unless the Old Chipster resurrects a half-dozen orcs to throw blocks, it will be another long, frustrating day for DeMarco. And this is assuming the RB plays. He left practice Wednesday with a hamstring injury. Give me Dion Lewis (vs. Jax), Matt Jones (at NYG) and Chris Ivory (vs. Phi) instead. "

S"The forces working against the two-time Pro Bowl selection are high in number: 1) Gravity, which impacts us all. 2) An 0-2 Seattle team returns home angry and hungry, 3) Arena League-level QB Jimmy Clausen will man the ship with Jay Cutler sidelined meaning stacked boxes will be aplenty, 4) The Bears offensive line has at times been a sieve, especially in pass-blocking, 5) Making matters worse, Kam Chancellor is no longer on his self-appointed hiatus. Most believe he'll suit up Sunday. Oh the carnage. Off the blocks, Forte is up to his same old tricks. He's been the workhorse operating as one of the game's ultimate dual threats. Against Green Bay and Arizona he totaled 271 combined yards on 48 touches with a touchdown, a productive line that has him ranked No. 4 among fantasy RBs. Though he'll again carry the mail, the situation, as discussed, is the antithesis of ideal. James Starks ran well against Seattle in absence of Eddie Lacy last Sunday night, but the 'Hawks have yielded only 3.37 yards per carry and the seventh-fewest fantasy points to RBs overall. Bear down indeed. "

S"I detest the 'Always Start Your Studs' theory. For the unfamiliar, it's the close-minded belief that any historically productive brand name MUST be started regardless of matchup. As repeatedly stated in this space over the years, no player is immune from down weeks. Not a single one. And who's to say Megatron, coming off an uneventful, injury-limited 2014, is still stud material? After getting pinched by Jason Verrett and the Chargers Week 1, Johnson responded with a sterling 10-83-1 effort (on 17 targets) last week in Minnesota. Xavier Rhodes and friends were body slammed, to say the least. Still, this week's matchup is incredibly daunting. Aqib Talib and Chris Harris, who each rank inside the top-six in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus, have given up a combined 30.9 QB rating, 57.8 catch percentage and 7.92 yards per catch to their assignments. Safety Darian Stewart has been equally spectacular checking in at No. 1 in coverage at his position. Throw in Matthew Stafford's ill health (ribs/back) and general ineptitude along with Denver's relentless pass rush and it's plain to see why I have Calvin ranked outside my top-24 WRs for Week 3. Fade all day in DFS. "

S"The 34-year-old is going the way of your grandpa. Much like the Colts offense as a whole, he's looked slow, stiff and ineffective. Tee times, bridge tournaments and strained peas are in his near future. He did see a fair amount of targets (17) against the Bills and Jets, but he recorded only seven receptions for 51 yards. Whippersnapper Donte Moncrief, who has turned the fantasy football world on its ear, has undoubtedly passed him by. This week, the veteran will place another toe in the grave. Under septuagenarian Dick LeBeau, the Titans defense has tightened up. Per PFF, Perish Cox (No. 10), Coty Sensabaugh (No. 33) and Blidi Wreh-Wilson (No. 38) all rank inside the top-40 in pass coverage. In total, the trio has conceded the ninth-fewest fantasy points to WRs and a lowly 42.8 catch percentage. Granted they did face a Mike Evans-less Buccaneers squad Week 1 and Cleveland in Week 2, but they're certainly better than advertised. Andrew Luck should get his groove back on the road, but count on the withering Johnson to again play a minimized role. Doug Baldwin (vs. Chi), Cecil Shorts (vs. TB) and Michael Crabtree (at Cle) own more Week 3 upside. "

S"When Foles was shipped from Philadelphia to St. Louis this past offseason, most believed the Eagles got the better end of the deal. However, after Sam Bradford's stomach-pumping performance against the Cowboys that perspective may have changed. Believe it or not, the Rams are off to a solid start, thanks in large part to Napoleon Dynamite's efforts. He hasn't lit the world on fire netting 16.6 fantasy points per game (QB19), but he's not entirely to blame. Rams receivers have dropped 11.9 percent of intended passes, the second-worst mark in the league. Overall, Foles continues to spin one of the better deep balls in the league, is highly effective on play action (137.5 QB rating) and has made sound decisions when pressured (81.0 accuracy percentage in those situations). His fantasy points per dropback (0.51) also ranks top-12, ahead of such position titans as Matt Ryan, Russell Wilson and Drew Brees. This week against a Steelers defense that made Colin Kaepernick look like Steve Young, Foles' stock is sure to rise. Pittsburgh corners William Gay and Antwon Blake have allowed a combined 75.0 catch percentage in the early season. Collectively, the Steelers have surrendered the most fantasy points to the position. For the reasons above and given the explosive nature of Todd Haley's offense \xe2\x80\x93 the shootout potential is high \xe2\x80\x93 Foles is the perfect remedy for suffering Tony Romo owners. "

S"Staring at Woodhead's fantastic headshot, he looks like a dude who subsists on granola and weed, a true mountain man. However, the plucky back from North Platte takes pleasure in a different type of high, nickel and dime-ing teams to death. As predicted preseason, he's supplanted hotshot rookie Melvin Gordon near the goal-line, functioning as pass-catching and rushing threat. He hasn't evaded many tacklers (No. 32 in elusive rating) or churned out hard yards (39.7 YAC%), but he's earned considerable red-zone trust, a valuable attribute to own in fantasy. Thus far, he's logged the third-most looks (9) inside the 20 among running backs. Gordon has made strides. His improved patience, vision and explosion were on display Week 2 in Cincinnati. However, his between-the-20s role will remain unchanged this week in Minnesota, a unique opportunity for both backs. The Vikings were gashed Week 1 by Carlos Hyde but righted this ship last week against Detroit surrendering only 84 combined yards to Ameer Abdullah and Co. Still, they've given up 5.5 yards per touch to RBs through two games. On another 13-15 touches, Woodhead should tally a useful RB2 line and drive Ragnar into a deeper depression.  "

S"The Florida product has much in common with a motorhome. He's big, hard to stop when moving downhill and is a sought after luxury item, off waivers. In a breakout performance against what many expect to be a rather inflexible St. Louis defensive line, Jones completely dominated from start to finish, outplaying incumbent Alfred Morris. Though he saw only 31 snaps, he carried the pill 19 times for 123 yards and two touchdowns. He also chipped in three receptions for 23 yards. At 6-foot-2, 230 pounds, Jones is a load. He's nimble, powerful, shifty and versatile. Overall, his game is patterned similarly to Carlos Hyde's. Though he'll work on short rest, the youngster is a viable RB2 in 12-team leagues against New York. Miniaturized on run defense, the Giants have allowed 137.5 total yards per game to opposing rushers through two games. Working behind a Washington offensive line that's executed beautifully thus far, he should flatten the competition on roughly 13-15 touches. Jones will continue to work in tandem with 'The Butler,' but Jay Gruden's desire to take pressure off Kirk Cousins via ball control only solidifies his growing role. If you were lucky enough to secure his services, turn the key. "

S"Extra crispy. That's what Miami DBs were last week after Robinson dropped them in the deep-fryer for six receptions, 155 yards and two touchdowns. Proving to be more than just a premier red-zone option, the sophomore target burned safety Walt Aikens with a double-move on a 52-yard scoring strike. Though Allen Hurns is also a featured player, it's pretty clear who Blake Bortles favors. Through two weeks Robinson has 18 targets to lead the team, and with Rashad Greene now on IR, that number is sure to multiply. Another weighty workload is on the horizon. Unsurprisingly, Tom Brady has launched ground-to-air missiles to begin the season, blowing up opposing defenses. Jacksonville, which surrendered 359 pass yards, two scores and 8.2 yards per attempt to Ryan Tannehill last Sunday, is his next victim, a plausible outcome that greatly benefits Robinson. If smoke continues to rise from Brady's hand, Bortles will most certainly be thrust into a high-volume situation. More pass attempts means more targets for Robinson. Not to mention he could exploit zone offerings in garbage time. WIth all that in mind and considering how poorly Pats corners Tarrell Brown (No. 90 in pass coverage per PFF) and Malcolm Butler (84.6 catch% allowed) have played, the Penn St. product is sure to cash handsomely. Load up. "

S"Due to small sample sizes, statistical anomalies in fantasy football are omnipresent this time each year. For example, Shorts has more targets (20) than widely perceived top-flight wide receivers A.J. Green (12), Randall Cobb (16) and Brandin Cooks (14). Of course, as the season wears on, that pecking order will most certainly change, but it clearly proves the Texans' affection for the veteran receiver. Though zeroed in, Shorts hasn't done much. He's caught just 10 passes for 91 yards. With defenses focused on containing DeAndre Hopkins, favorable workloads should continue to be the norm for the ex-Jag. If he generates another eight-plus targets, this could be the week he busts out. Tampa Bay stunned the league last week by handling business inside the Superdome. Disemboweled Week 1 versus Marcus Mariota and the Titans, the Bucs plunged daggers into New Orleans holding the Saints to a very uncharacteristic 323 total yards and 4.7 average gain per play. Despite the stiff defensive effort, questions loom long-term, particularly at corner. Jonathan Banks and Alterraun Verner both rank outside the top-50 in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus. Together the tandem have yielded two touchdowns and a 120.7 QB rating to their assignments. All told, the Bucs have given up 8.59 pass yards per attempt. Ryan Mallett was unsightly at times last week in Carolina (46.6 cmp%, 4.2 ypa), but with the butterflies out of the way, he should take a step forward. Consider Shorts a sneaky WR3 or FLEX option in 12-team and deeper formats. "

S'To quote Prince, Montgomery is the "kind you find in a secondhand store." Barely a blip on the fantasy radar, the rookie from Stanford is about to make his mark. Last week against Seattle, he played on 25 snaps (of 71), up from just one in Week 1, was targeted four times and caught four passes for 37 yards. Though his role was limited, he ran polished routes, plucked passes cleanly and gained tough yards after the catch. With Davante Adams dinged (ankle) and defenses attentive to Randall Cobb, his playing time may surge in Week 3. His opponent, the Chiefs, are the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation of football -- they give and give and ... Exposed by allegedly cooked Peyton Manning and \'unstoppable\' Brian Hoyer, the Chiefs have allowed a staggering 41 receptions for 516 yards and four TDs to WRs thus far. No surprise, Marcus Peters, Phillip Gaines and Jamell Flemming have conceded receptions on 61.2 percent of balls thrown their way. Lowering the bar, Flemming ranks No. 99 (of 99) in pass coverage per Pro Football Focus. And he\'s bottom barrel by a wide margin. Suffice it to say, Aaron Rodgers is about to go nuts, especially if Eddie Lacy is out or limited. The kid is a gamble, but spin the roulette wheel and the ball just might land on 88. Among the $10 WR crowd, no one possesses more upside in Week 3 than Montgomery.  '

S"We're fully aware of the Bradford narrative. He's an underachieving former No. 1 overall pick who would get injured partaking in (insert non-strenuous activity). Still, he is tasked with driving the Eagles' highly explosive, supersonic-paced offense. Suffice it to say, opportunities will be aplenty, if the delicate QB can stay glued together. Philly ran 70.4 offensive plays per game and averaged nearly 37 pass attempts per contest last season. In a clash where defense will be a premium, Bradford will easily cross the 40-attempt threshold. On the back-end, Atlanta has serious question marks. Corner Desmond Trufant, who ranked No. 11 in coverage and surrendered just a 74.0 QB rating to his assignments a season ago per Pro Football Focus, is an established, rigid veteran. However, his tag-team partner Robert Alford (111.6 QB RTG allowed in '14) and young safeties William Moore (109.0) and Ricardo Allen are rather giving in nature. Collectively, the 'Clean' Birds conceded 8.1 pass yards per attempt in 2014. In a game that should exhaust the scoreboard operator (56 over/under in Vegas), Slingin' Sam hooks up with Jordan Matthews multiple times and delivers a top-five line. Those who stole him in the double-digit rounds are about to reap considerable reward. "

S"After a promising preseason, everyone's favorite buff rodent is on the verge of repairing his wrecked fantasy image. Martin was epically awful the past two years. He missed holes, danced to nowhere and logged 1-yard or less on 26.4 percent of his carries. With Charles Sims breathing down his neck, most predicted he would finally be put out of his misery. However, he showed up to camp leaner and meaner. As a result, he performed brilliantly over the exhibition slate (5.9 ypc, 69.1 YAC%), displaying the short-field quickness and in-space wiggle indicative of his rookie season. Extremely motivated to reestablish himself as Tampa's lead back and running behind a Bucs offensive line that ranked No. 8 in run-blocking last fall, he will continue to shine. Aggressiveness is the hallmark of Dick LeBeau's 3-4 defense. Exotic run/pass blitzes will be the norm. However, Tennessee's personnel leaves a lot to be desired. Jurrell Casey is a very active edge defender and offseason acquisition, Brian Orakpo, will plug numerous gaps, but the Titans have miles to go before earning a sterling reputation. Recall a season ago they yielded a league-high 125.1 rushing yards per game and the second-most fantasy points to RBs. Provided Jameis Winston prevents stacked boxes, the Hamster spins the wheel on roughly 18-22 touches. "

S"Since April, I've penned thousands of poetic words about the rookie. In my head, an angel choir sings whenever his name is uttered. Though the buzz from his spectacular preseason debut has quieted, Abdullah remains dreamy. He's a versatile, low-to-the-ground rusher who might possess the best juke button in the league. His patience, vision and lateral agility are top-notch, qualities that typically embarrass would-be tacklers. It's tough to pinpoint exactly how much work Abdullah will receive Sunday. Theo Riddick will be peppered in some 6-8 times operating as a gadget back. Meanwhile, Joique Bell, activated off the PUP only a little over a week ago, may be worked in slowly. Fellow rookie Zach Zenner would likely fill the power back void if Joique were unavailable. Still, the Nebraska product should tote the heavy side in the timeshare, possibly surpassing 15 total touches. Against the run, San Diego was a bend, don't break, defense in 2014. Corey Liuget is a menace in the trenches, but, by in large, the Chargers' D-line is average at best. Last year, it conceded a respectable 4.05 yards per carry, but struggled mightily containing versatile RBs, as Fred Jackson, Justin Forsett and Ronnie Hillman proved. For the frugal, there might be no better RB buy than the rookie. Fear Ameer.  "

S"The adoration I house for Coleman rivals my fodness for Abdullah. The rookie from Indiana makes my heart go pitter pat. Currently atop the Falcons depth chart with Devonta Freeman ailing, Coleman is hungry and motivated to solidify his standing as Atlanta's lead horse. Due to a hamstring strain, he played only sparingly in the preseason, galloping his way to eight carries on 56 yards in the final regular season tuneup. In that contest he displayed considerable explosiveness around the edge, his calling card. Overall, Coleman is a versatile, one-cut rusher with drag-racer wheels. His upright running style leaves him vulnerable to viscious hits and negative plays, but he did gain 38 of 58 yards after contact in exhibition action, a promising sign. Combine that with his plus hands and adept pass-blocking and he's a legitimate three-down back. Philly's 3-4 D, spearheaded by former Bill Kiko Alonso, is downright nasty. Last year, the Eagles allowed only 3.54 yards per carry to RBs. Against a highly suspect Atlanta offensive line, wide running lanes could be few and far between, though Matt Ryan and Julio Jones could change that. In a game with enormous scoring potential, Coleman should inflict considerable damage, much of it levied on screens and flares. The door of opportunity is wide open. On Monday night, the youngster sprints through it. "

S"Hear the name 'Rueben Randle' and mental images of supreme lameness are conjured -- road trips to Flint, Mark from accounting, chihuahuas, Bud Light. But fight off those perceptions, Randle is 100 percent flame worthy in Week 1. Whether in season-long or DFS, Odell Beckham's sidekick is a highly recommended play. Historically, Eli Manning has undressed the Cowboys. In his past four meetings versus the division rival, he tossed 12 touchdowns. Of course, Randle didn't catch a single one, but he did net a serviceable 4.5 receptions and 68.8 yards per game in those contests. This time around, the receiver should easily exceed those averages. Minus lock-down corner Orlando Scandrick, Dallas' secondary is hurting. Expected starters Brandon Carr and Morris Claiborne, when on the field, were repeatedly battered and bruised last year. Assignments caught 60.9 percent of their intended targets against the pair. Toss in the added attention OBJ is sure to draw and Randle possesses extraordinary potential. He's a chronic underachiever and at least half-awful, but he has a great shot of mirroring his Week 1 2013 (6-5-101-0) output in Dallas. Confidently roll the dice. "

S"Brown has blown through the desert with haboob force. Equipped with electric quickness and reliable hands, the sophomore receiver has defensive backs on notice. In the six games Carson Palmer was under center last year, Brown played brilliantly. On 40 targets, he totaled 20 receptions for 315 yards and scored three times. Extrapolate what he accomplished during that span over a full 16 game slate and he would've finished No. 18 among fantasy wide receivers. Dynamite in preseason play, he should carry momentum into the meaningful slate. New Orleans provides a unique opportunity. Down his best cover man, Keenan Lewis, Saints DC Rob Ryan is will rely on the not-so-dynamic duo of Brandon Browner and Delvin Breaux. The former ranked No. 65 in coverage last season according to Pro Football Focus. The latter, meanwhile, is a NFL-inexperienced DB who climbed an long ladder to reach the Crescent City. A local product, Breaux was a standout in the Gridiron Developmental League, Arena League and CFL before inking a deal with his hometown squad this past spring. His story is nothing short of remarkable, but Brown is unlike any assignment he's seen. With Michael Floyd very questionable and Larry Fitzgerald tied to the slot, JB pops off the top. "

S'When the bell sounds, Jacksonville\'s "hitman" will throw multiple haymakers. Very quietly, the second-year target had a standout camp and preseason. Adding muscle to his wiry 6-foot-3 frame this past offseason, he was physical off the line and looked quick and polished throughout exhibition play. Overall, he played 81 snaps, caught six passes (on nine targets) for 59 yards and scored a touchdown. Those numbers weren\'t galactic by any stretch, but the eye test lends confidence he\'ll build on his underrated rookie campaign (51-677-6). Keep in mind he\'s locked into the WR2 role opposite Allen Robinson, who should attract generous attention from defenders. Most encouraging for Hurns, Blake Bortles is no longer swimming laps in a cesspool. The QB exhibited terrific pocket poise, delivered accurate passes and was generally a complete 180 from the shellshocked youngster seen last year. Questions remain, but if that version of Bortles appears when the real bullets fly, everyone in the offense stands to benefit. Most anticipate the Panthers D, throttled by injuries last year, to rebound. However, recently concussed corners Charles Tillman and Josh Norman, though cleared for Week 1 action, are not at full strength. Bene Benwiekre was excellent in coverage last year (72.9 QB rating allowed), but Hurns may only draw him sporadically. At a super-cheap $15 in Yahoo DFS, he\'s a fantastic low-dollar option who gives owners the flexibility to slap the wallet for the likes of Aaron Rodgers ($48), Julio Jones ($39) or Rob Gronkowski ($29).'

S"Sadly, St. Louis will be the 'Gateway to Suck' for the Seattle QB. In six previous appearances against the Rams, Wilson posted rather pedestrian numbers (212.2 pass yards per game, 33.3 rushing yards per game, 6:4 TD:INT split). The seventh time around likely won't reverse the trend. Full disclosure, the passer dazzled the last time he visited St. Louis. Against an undermanned Rams defense he rolled up 419 combined yards and three total touchdowns. However in that game pocket menace Chris Long was out due to injury, a significant missing piece. With his ankle now at 100 percent Long and Robert Quinn should form arguably the most relentless 1-2 pass rush in the league. Toss in Nick Fairley's presence inside and the Rams defensive line looks quite fearsome, a daunting assignment for Seattle's transparent offensive line. Similar to last regular season, Wilson was badgered repeatedly in exhibition play. His 42.5 percent under pressure rate was second only to Carson Palmer's 46.2 among first-stringers. Jimmy Graham is a tree who should help alleviate some duress, but the heat will likely be intense. In what should be a scoring struggle, Ciara's cuddle-only buddy finishes outside the QB1 ranks in 12-team leagues. "

S'I can already hear the reactions to the JC of KC\'s inclusion on this list: "Crazy." "Reckless." "Irresponsible." "Just plain dumb." Charles definitely warranted a top-five overall pick. He\'s a three-down fixture in an Andy Reid offense that typically utilizes rushers in variable ways. He\'s also averaged 5.49 yards per carry in his career, a mark second all-time only to 40s/50s Cleveland Browns steamroller Marion Motley. However, there are forces working against His Holiness this week in Houston. The Texans should be exceptional against the run this season. Adding \'Plus-sized Mario\' Vince Wilfork, who ranked top-10 among DTs against the run in 2014, to the Brian Cushing/J.J. Watt/Jadeveon Clowney mix only reinforces the seawall. Even without Wilfork, and for a large chunk Clowney, Houston surrendered a mere 4.09 yards per carry and three total TDs to RBs in eight home contests last year. Behind a reshuffled KC offensive line, which ranked in the lower third in run-blocking a season ago per Pro Football Focus, it could be tough sledding for Charles. Keep in mind, Reid occasionally forgets No. 25 is on the field. The Chief reached lameness seven times in 16 games last year. Similar to what he did in \'14, he stumbles out of the blocks. Spend your DFS dimes elsewhere. '

S"Your morbidly obese uncle probably ran harder than Gordon this summer. The rookie exhibited marginal vision, elusiveness and short-field quickness throughout the preseason finishing with a god awful 2.2 yards per carry. Though San Diego's permeable offensive line did him no favors, he struggled terribly adjusting to the Chargers' zone-blocking scheme, a system predicated on decisive cuts and downhill running. Gordon owns explosive speed and deceptive power, but severe limitations in other categories will likely keep him off the field until rectified. He's a below average pass-blocker and largely unspectacular as a receiver. Danny Woodhead, a much beloved and integral contributor, will play a substantial role within San Diego's proposed committee. Back from a broken leg, he's slated to reprise his gig as Swiss Army Knife. He'll see consistent action on pass/third downs and chip in the occasional goal-line tote, a presumed 10-12 touch per game workload is sure to madden Gordon owners. With Ndamukong Suh and Fairley no longer in Lions blue, Detroit's defensive line is more vulnerable than it's been in years. It would be no surprise if it ranked middle of the pack or worse against the run. Still, the San Diego's muddy RB waters don't lend much confidence. Tevin Coleman (vs. Phi), Rashad Jennings (at Dal) and Chris Ivory (vs. Cle) offer more Week 1 upside. "

S"For the most part, I fully expect the geriatric to splash gleefully in the Fountain of Youth. With Breshad Perriman still possibly weeks away from returning and without much proven talent on roster, he truly is the only game in town. Though his workload will be significant, possibly exceeding 10 targets per game unto the rookie's return, his opening week matchup doesn't warrant warm and fuzzy feelings. In what will become a familiar theme for wide receivers this season, Denver is a place where production dies. Chris Harris, the No. 1 ranked cover corner in the league last season according to Pro Football Focus' metrics, and Aqib Talib are a blanketing tandem. Thrown at 184 times last season, they surrendered just 101 catches (54.8 catch percentage) at a clip of 9.64 yards per catch, a league low. Most impressively, not a soul scored a TD on Harris the entire regular season. No one. Joe Flacco has to throw to somebody. Smith, however, may do little with his opportunities. Sunnier days are ahead, but the veteran's Week 1 forecast is ominous. "

S'This week, the Colts receiver may have more in common with the Bates Motel than the Hilton. Ralph Wilson Stadium will present numerous nightmares for visiting teams this season. Rex Ryan inherited an aggressive, lock-down defense, one that he will likely mold and shape into the NFL\'s best. Still, some view the Bills secondary as a weakness, specifically rookie corner Ronald Darby. The No. 50 overall pick in last May\'s NFL Draft, however, is no pushover. Ryan repeatedly talked him up throughout training camp and is unafraid of the kid\'s inexperience. GM Doug Whaley echoed the viewpoint noting Darby "exceeded expectations" in August. Match him with Stephen Gilmore and Corey Graham, DBs that ranked inside the top-25 in pass coverage according to PFF last year, and Hilton will have his hands full. Equally worrisome, Andrew Luck, working behind a largely ineffective offensive line, will be in a pressure cooker much of the afternoon. If that happens, deep shots downfield will be few and far between. Also recall Buffalo yielded a league-low 16 passing touchdowns last fall. Put it all together and it could be an uneventful start for the Pro Bowl wideout. '
