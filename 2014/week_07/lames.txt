Drew Brees, NO, QB (65%)
Matchup: at Det
Whether in Fantasyland or zombie-apocalyptic Georgia, sometimes you're the cattle, other times the butcher. This week, Brees would pair nicely with a sesame seed bun. He's averaged a robust 314.8 passing yards per game, but the former All-Pro hasn't found the end zone with his usual regularity. If his 28-TD pace holds, it would be his lowest total since 2007, his second year with the Saints. New Orleans' goal-line efficiency on the ground coupled with Darren Sproles' absence are likely reasons for his profitless return. He's crossed the 20-fantasy-point threshold in every game this season, but, without the services of his best weapon, Jimmy Graham, a marginal week could be in store. Keep in mind 35.8 percent of Brees' TD passes since Week 1 last season have gone to the TE. In the recent past, the Lions were one of the more accommodating pass defenses in the league. Once routinely spanked through the air, Rashean Mathis and Darius Slay have played brilliantly. Combined they've allowed a 64.2 QB rating and 52.1 catch percentage. As a unit, Detroit has yet to give up a multi-TD passer and surrendered only 6.33 yards per attempt. And that was against the likes of Aaron Rodgers, Cam Newton and Eli Manning. On the road, Brees, by the standard he established previously, blows. 
Fearless Forecast: 28-43, 267 passing yards, 2 touchdowns, 2 interceptions, 19.3 fantasy points 

Andre Williams, NYG, RB (51%)
Matchup: at Dal
When Rashad Jennings suffered a knee sprain two weeks ago, the Williams hype machine went into overdrive. His worked up owners, ecstatic about his increased role, threw out adjectives like "must-start," "stud" and "love muffin" when waxing poetically about the rookie's Week 6 value. One humiliating night in Philadelphia later and it's time for everyone to reassess. When he gets a full head of steam, the Boston College product is a load of bricks. As his 57.1 yards after contact percentage proves, he's a tough dude to bring down. However, he's blessed with the elusiveness of a fixed object, struggles in pass protection and is one-sixteenth the receiver of, say, an Alfred Morris. Point blank, he's an average power back with limited upside. The Giants offensive line did him no favors in Philly, but on the year he's averaged a yack-worthy 3.25 yards per carry. Jennings is likely to miss action for the second straight week, but keep your expectations tempered. Thanks to the stellar execution of defensive tackle Henry Melton and linebacker Justin Durant, the Cowboys have crushed naysayers (Me included) who believed only weeks ago they would be a pushover in all facets defensively. They've given up 5.65 yards per carry to RBs this year, but Arian Foster and Zac Stacy are the only rushers to register top-15 days against them. Unless New York actually employs real Giants to run block, Williams will again be the epitome of mediocrity. 
Fearless Forecast: 18 carries, 70 rushing yards, 1 reception, 6 receiving yards, 0 touchdowns, 8.3 fantasy points 

Frank Gore, SF, RB (68%)
Matchup: at Den
The beginning of the end could already be underway for one of the toughest, most consistent performers to man the RB position this century. According to a recent Ian Rapoport report, the veteran had to earn a roster spot this past summer after the club invested a high draft pick in Carlos Hyde. That tidbit may seem outrageous, especially for a highly productive back who's been the backbone of the Niners organization for the past decade, but based on his dramatic decline over the second half last year, there's truth to it. He looked tremendous against Philly and KC totaling 227 yards and a TD in those efforts, however, he's slowly eroding under the surface. His 46.5 yards after contact percentage is indicative of power lost. More disturbing, in a snug game late in St. Louis, Jim Harbaugh leaned on Hyde to salt away the clock. He could rack a couple more RB2 level games, but his 2014 worth has likely peaked. A difficult road matchup against the Broncos will only solidify that belief. With Von Miller again playing exceptional football, Denver's run D is one of the league's nastiest. RBs are netting just 2.90 yards per carry against it. Rushers have had success in the vertical game against the Broncos, but Gore, with only four receptions on the year, has limitations in that capacity. Seek help elsewhere. 
Fearless Forecast: 14 carries, 44 rushing yards, 1 receptions, 3 receiving yards, 0 touchdowns, 5.4 fantasy points

Keenan Allen, SD, WR (64%)
Matchup: vs. KC
What the heck, Keenan? Without a touchdown and averaging a pedestrian 49.3 receiving yards per game, he's slipped into a deep sophomore slump. Including Antonio Gates, he's the fourth-most valuable receiver on his team. In per game average, he ranks outside the top-60 among fantasy WRs, behind the likes of Travis Benjamin, Ricardo Lockette and Jarvis Landry. Gag. Because Philip Rivers is one bushy beard and "Manifesto" shy of being Karl Marx, Allen has gotten lost in the socialist shuffle. At least, that's what it seems. In truth, Allen's presence has increased compared to last year. A season ago, he accounted for 19.1 percent of San Diego's targets. This year, that number has grown to 21.1 percent. He's seen a slight dip in red-zone looks, but, given his prominent role, he should right the ship soon. However, don't expect him to hit the comeback trail this week. KC corner Sean Smith is among the league's best in pass coverage. He's surrendered a 50.0 catch percentage, 11.5 yards per catch and 76.6 QB rating in five games. Collectively, the Chiefs have allowed only four wideouts to score double-digit fantasy points this year. Brighter days are ahead, but this week, Allen's price tag hits a career low. 
Fearless Forecast: 5 receptions, 52 receiving yards, 0 touchdowns, 8.9 fantasy points 

Reggie Wayne, Ind, WR (55%)
Matchup: vs. Cin
It won't be long before Wayne receives a call from Canton. The six-time Pro Bowl selection ranks top-10 all-time in receptions and receiving yards. Off a shortened 2013 in which he suffered a catastrophic knee injury, he's rebounded fairly well. He ranks near the top in targets (54) and has posted an identical line as Houston's Andre Johnson (34-419-1). Maybe the former "U" dudes will ride a tandem bike soon too. His subsequent 8.0 fantasy points per game places him barely inside the WR top-36. Because of his high-volume, he's still fairly reliable, but matched against a stringent Bengals secondary, lackluster production is in the forecast. Starting corners Terence Newman and Leon Hall have given up just 9.4 yards per catch to their assignments and a 75.8 QB rating. Only Steve Smith, Julio Jones and Kelvin Benjamin have scored 10-plus fantasy points against them. In total, Cincy has conceded the sixth-fewest fantasy points to WRs. Wayne should again entice 7-9 targets, but an outcome similar to last week (9-4-35-0 at Hou) is in the cards. 
Fearless Forecast: 5 receptions, 50 receiving yards, 0 touchdowns, 8.7 fantasy points
