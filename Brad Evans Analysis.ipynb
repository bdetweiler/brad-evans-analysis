      "matchup: Justin Forsett, Sea, RB (51% started)\n",
      "fearless_forecast: Regardless of Julius Jones' situation, Forsett is USDA certified Grade-A flame. Collectively, Hawks rushers have averaged 3.7 yards per carry and the fewest total yards in the league. Prior to Forsett's rise to prominence, Jim Mora sporadically tried to feed the rushing attack. Only success against flaccid opponents was achieved. But the former Cal standout has jumpstarted the ground game. Though he rushed for only nine yards on an equal number of carries last week in Minnesota, the undersized runner – the latest height-challenged back to reap success – has averaged 119 total yards per game and totaled two scores in his past two games. Decisive, quick and powerful according to Mora, he is a terrific multidimensional weapon. Those skills should cause chaos in St. Louis. The Rams have performed poorly against the run for much of the season, especially of late. Since Week 7, they've yielded 5.5 yards per carry, 191.8 total yards per game and five scores to backs, equal to the third-most fantasy points allowed. Jones will start if healthy, but even if he suits up, Forsett should net at least 12-15 touches. (minus Jones)\n",

      "matchup: LeSean McCoy, Phi, RB (58% started)\n",
      "fearless_forecast: With Brian Westbrook in a daze, the Noise has danced romantically with the rookie's Fathead likeness over the past couple weeks. Our song: Spandu Ballet's \"True.\" The Eagles staff finally pulled its heads-from-posterior last week against the Bears, running McCoy 20 times. Despite what could've been a costly late-game fumble, he totaled 99 yards and a touchdown. In three starts this season, the multi-tooled back has averaged 82.3 total yards per game and splashed pay-dirt twice. Similar numbers lie ahead against division rival Washington, which could again be without premier run stopper Albert Haynesworth. Even with the hole-plunger active, the 'Skins have struggled containing the run. Since Week 7, they've conceded 5.4 yards per carry to RBs. Assuming Marty Mornhinweg continues to strive for balance and the Eagles' front can sustain its blocks, McCoy should again be a very useful RB2 in 12-team formats.\n",
      "player: \n",
      "matchup: Chris Chambers, KC, WR (24% started)\n",
      "fearless_forecast: Revenge could taste very sweet for the former Charger. Kicked to the curb by San Diego earlier this season, the veteran has regained his long-distance form in KC. Since joining the Chiefs he's scored twice and averaged 83 yards per game. Over the past five weeks, only three receivers have surpassed the 70-yard mark against the Bolts. But Chambers' familiarity with the secondary and motivation to prove his previous employer wrong are factors which can't be ignored. After last week's stunning upset of Pittsburgh, the wideout sincerely believes Todd Haley's offensive is finally \"progressing.\" No longer burdened by Larry Johnson's black cloud and with Matt Cassel's time in the pocket increasing, Chambers' observations aren't farfetched. Another competitive performance is in order.\n",
      "player: \n",
      "matchup: Pierre Garcon, Ind, WR (23% started)\n",
      "fearless_forecast: Inconsistency has occasionally plagued the former Mount Union star, but over the past few weeks he has really discovered a groove. As Stampede Blue noted earlier this week, Garcon is growing up right before people's eyes. His first career 100-yard effort last week in Baltimore is proof. With Austin Collie taking a backseat and more defenses forced to rotate help to Reggie Wayne's side, the second-year wideout has drawn increased looks from Peyton Manning. Since Week 7 he's averaged 8.6 targets and 59 yards per game. Houston has yielded the fewest fantasy points to receivers during that same span, but with matchups against vertically challenged Buffalo and Tennessee that ranking is deceiving. Garcon snapped five catches for 60 yards in their first meeting. Expect him to pay a higher dividend against a Houston secondary minus starting safety Eugene Wilson.\n",
      "player: \n",
      "matchup: Michael Crabtree, SF, WR (34% started)\n",
      "fearless_forecast: The third time will be the charm for Crabtree. Failing to march into flame territory in his previous two appearances on this list, the sticky-fingered rookie should easily surpass the seven-point threshold this time around. Corner Tyron Brackenridge, filling in for injured former All-Pro Rashean Mathis, was humilated last week by Terrell Owens. Though Crabtree doesn't possess the experience of T.O., his slick route-running and size will wreak havoc. The Jags have allowed the fifth-most fantasy points to receivers since Week 7, surrendering a pair of fives in touchdowns and 70-yard performances. San Francisco has produced unsteady yields in the passing game for much of the season. But Alex Smith's comfort level and success operating out of the spread has forced Mike Singletary and Jimmy Raye to reinvent the wheel. The former Red Raider, a huge proponent of the system, is certainly pushing the staff to stretch personnel packages horizontally. Assuming the handcuffs are again taken off Smith, Crabtree should be an elite No. 3 in Week 12.\n",

      "matchup: Jermichael Finley, GB, TE (18% started)\n",
      "fearless_forecast: Forget turkey. Finley instead plans to feast on a holiday delicacy - Lion. After missing several games with a sprained knee, the talented tight end is finally 100 percen and producing. Last week against San Fran, he attracted 10 targets catching seven passes for 54 yards. Interestingly, he operated almost exclusively out of the slot in an attempt to draw one-on-one coverage. If Mike McCarthy follows a similar blueprint, Finley will carve up the Hello Kitties. His size and athleticism is a matchup nightmare. On the year, the Lions have allowed nine touchdowns to oversized targets, the most in the league. Look for that number to increase in Week 12. For frustrated Jason Witten owners fed up with his underperformance or worried about his availability on Thanksgiving, Finley could be just what the doctor ordered.\n",
