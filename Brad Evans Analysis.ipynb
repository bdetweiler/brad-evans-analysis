    "Interesting. Using Yahoo! Fantasy standard scoring, we see the distribution of actual fantasy points from Brad's Flames and Lames picks. The most interesting thing we can garner from this is that the distributions are strikingly similar. However, if Brad's picks were generally correct, they should be at opposite ends. But instead, it seems that his Lames are a lot better off than his Flames. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, success and failure are relative terms, but at some point we need to draw a line in the sand. For me personally, less than 10 points is pretty lame. But a flame needs a little more kick, so I would set the bar at 15 points. \n",

      "Flames Max (good): 2013-12-15 - 33.18 fantasy points, Alex Smith (RB - KC)\n",
      "Brad sez: Distancing himself from the game-manager stereotype, Smith has achieved relatively solid numbers in recent weeks without much fanfare. Since Week 7, he's averaged 220.4 passing yards and 25.4 rushing yards per game with five multi-score performances. His final tally suffered a bit last week in Washington largely due to an enormous early lead. As a result, he bled the clock, attempting only 20 passes. However, against an exploitable Oakland that impossibly made Geno Smith appear competent, he should deliver QB1 production when needed most. Over the past five weeks, only New England, Minnesota and Indy have been more generous to opposing signal callers than the Silver and Yack. Including Geno's four-TD improbable 23-point fantasy effort in standard Yahoo leagues, six passers have finished inside the QB top-12 against the Raiders this season. Oakland's highest-rated corner, Tracy Porter (63.0 catch%age allowed), ranks No. 91 in pass coverage per Pro Football Focus. And, again, he's their best. Owners who've survived with sketchy options at quarterback should strongly consider banging the tribal drum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flames Min (bad): 2009-10-18 - -4.2 fantasy points, Nate Washington (WR - Ten)\n",
      "Brad sez: The Jerry Garcia of NFL receivers, Washington, who will be selling autographed tie-dye shirts and incense on a Foxboro street corner after Sunday's game, remarked this week despite the Titans winless record, his teammates are, positively and negatively, motivated by \"love.\" Pass the bong, dude. Due to Tennessee's stiffness in the trenches and inadequacies in downfield coverage, quarterbacks have feasted vertically on the Titans which has forced Jeff Fisher to abandon the run, a common occurrence that has benefited Washington. Ranked No. 39 in points per games at his position, the former Steeler has averaged 7.4 targets per game and totaled three touchdowns. Just three receivers have surpassed 80-yards against the Pats, but in a game in which Tennessee could once again be buried early, the Titans' top target should be thrust into an opportunity to rack numerous catches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lames Max (bad): 2012-11-04 - 51.2 fantasy points, Doug Martin (RB - TB)\n",
      "Brad sez: An offensive line without Carl Nicks is akin to U2 sans The Edge. Losing the mountain-moving guard, undoubtedly one of the league's premier run-blockers, is a crippling blow to Martin's rest of season value. Talk about bad timing. Everything was finally coming together for the rookie rusher. Over the past few weeks, the Bucs pass game and O-line had clearly clicked, opening up walrus wide holes for the youngster to burst through. His otherworldly 214 total yard, 2-TD performance last week in Minnesota was clear proof. It's hard to predict exactly how the Bucs offense will react to Nicks' absence, but this week's matchup was tough to begin with. The Raiders, widely believed to be softies between the tackles, have hardened of late. Over the past five weeks, Oakland has yielded just 3.4 yards per carry to RBs. And on the season hole plunger Richard Seymour ranks seventh against the run, regardless of defensive position, according to Pro Football Focus. Matt Shaughnessy, Rolando McClain and Philip Wheeler also rank highly. Martin's dynamite versatility and substantial workload are major turn-ons, but the opponent and departure of Nicks muddies his expected performance in O-Town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lames Min (good): 2012-09-16 - -2.3 fantasy points, Dez Bryant (WR - Dal)\n",
      "Brad sez: Inconsistency continues to be the norm for Dez. A centerpiece of the Dallas attack in the first half against New York, he stayed in the shadows after halftime, grabbing just one pass in the third quarter. His final line (4-85-0) was laudable, but his low target yield (5) and Kevin Ogletree's emergence are a bit worrisome. In many ways, he's the new Vincent Jackson, a completely unreliable performer on a week-in, week-out basis. This week in Seattle, expect the seesaw to sink. Corners Richard Sherman and Brandon Browner are one dynamic duo. Week 1 in 'Zona, the pair did a masterful job keeping Larry Fitzgerald under wraps. Sure Tony Romo is light years better than John Skelton/Kevin Kolb, but considering the secondary's lock-down attitude, the 'Hawks' raucous home crowd and Dez's vulnerability to vanishing, he is a highly suspect option in Week 2. As Jerry Jones admitted this week, the young wideout, \"Has to get better at everything he does.\"\n",
