But in Eli's return to the bayou, Smith may tally his first mediocre performance of the season. Under the visionary guidance of coordinator Gregg Williams, the Saints defense has improved significantly, especially versus the pass. Picked apart aerially a season ago, New Orleans has allowed just four 70-yard games and two TDs to wideouts this year. Smith is notorious for finding creases in zone coverage and will likely do so with some success against Williams' blitz-intense schemes.

Due to New England's coverage shortcomings, Perry Fewell will likely install an aggressive vertical gameplan.

The other, another RB afterthought on draft day, Arian Foster. This week's tango with Tampa presents Brown's toughest test yet. No team has surrendered fewer rushing yards per game (70.9) than the Bucs. Only Alfred Morris and Adrian Peterson have surpassed 75 ground yards against them.

Of course, time-zone genius Geno Smith will actually have to show up to meetings and throw him a few catchable balls, but a top-30 finish is entirely likely. \", 'opponent': 'Den'}, 529: {'week': '06', 'receptions': '5', 'completions': nan, 'total_yards': nan, 'receiving_yards': '68', 'player_percent_started': 0.21, 'attempts': nan, 'year': '2014', 'shocker_special': False, 'home': False, 'passing_touchdowns': nan, 'date_posted': '2014-10-08', 'interceptions': nan, 'rushing_yards': nan, 'rushing_touchdowns': nan, 'player_name': 'Owen Daniels', 'defensive_interceptions': nan, 'player_team': 'Bal', 'fumbles_lost': nan, 'sacks': nan, 'away': True, 'fantasy_points': '16.5', 'total_touchdowns': nan, 'carries': nan, 'points_allowed': nan, 'passing_yards': nan, 'fumbles_recovered': nan, 'turnovers': nan, 'player_position': 'TE', 'flame_lame': 'flames', 'blurb': \"Losing Dennis Pitta to yet another hip injury was a serious blow to Joe Flacco and the Ravens' vertical attack, but thankfully, for fantasy and Baltimore fans, Daniels has elevated his game.

Through two games, Romo has only attempted six passes beyond 20 yards, completing one, choosing instead to attack defenses in the short-to-intermediate field. He\\'s also been terrible on play-action posting a QB rating of just 38.0 in those situations. That lack of production downfield has justifiably prompted many to question how healthy his back really is. But this is the week Romo regains his QB1 mojo. Yes, the Rams have yet to allow a 175-yard passer, but they faced Cassel and Josh McCown in consecutive weeks. Overall, they\\'ve surrendered 7.5 yards per attempt to passers and starting DBs E.J. Gaines and Janoris Jenkins have yielded a catch rate of 65.0 percent to their assignments. Don\\'t be fooled by the superficial numbers. Since 2007, Romo has finished inside the QB top-10 in per game average every year. Though doubt is creeping in, this is the matchup that reassures owners he can still play at a starter-worthy level.

Not long ago, CJ2K was the most feared running back in the league. His superhuman speed and well-rounded game were virtually unmatched. During his six-year stint in Nashville, he amassed nearly 10,000 yards from scrimmage and splashed pay-dirt 58 times. Unfortunately, the organization's downward spiral coupled with a deteriorating skill set made Johnson expendable. As a Jet, he's only shown glimpses of his former brilliance, but in a game with considerable personal meaning, CJ could exhibit Pro Bowl form. The Titans defensive line is a wall of pillows. On the year, only Atlanta and Cincinnati have surrendered more fantasy points to RBs. When you give up 131 yards to plodder Andre Williams, that exemplifies how wretched you really are. Including Williams, Tennessee has allowed 100-plus total yards to a RB in five straight tilts. Johnson, who's toted the rock 35 times the past two games, is sure to add to that total.

According to Indy Star contributor Stephen Holder, the Colts are optimistic Reggie Wayne will return to action this week after sitting Week 8 with an elbow injury. Even if he returns, Moncrief should play a substantial role. The youngster is simply too good to be utilized in a limited capacity. Another 35-plus snaps are completely realistic. Spearheaded by Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and Prince Amukamura, the Giants secondary has performed admirably this year. Combined they've conceded a 53.8 catch rate and 65.7 QB rating. Overall, only five wide receivers have reached the 60-yard mark against New York. Though the paper matchup is unappealing, Moncrief's imposing stature and veteran-like approach should win the day. In a brutal bye week, he's a highly employable WR3. \", 'opponent': 'NYG'}, 601: {'week': '09', 'receptions': '4', 'completions': nan, 'total_yards': nan, 'receiving_yards': '57', 'player_percent_started': 0.41000000000000003, 'attempts': nan, 'year': '2014', 'shocker_special': False, 'home': True, 'passing_touchdowns': nan, 'date_posted': '2014-10-29', 'interceptions': nan, 'rushing_yards': nan, 'rushing_touchdowns': nan, 'player_name': 'Travis Kelce', 'defensive_interceptions': nan, 'player_team': 'KC', 'fumbles_lost': nan, 'sacks': nan, 'away': False, 'fantasy_points': '14.7', 'total_touchdowns': nan, 'carries': nan, 'points_allowed': nan, 'passing_yards': nan, 'fumbles_recovered': nan, 'turnovers': nan, 'player_position': 'TE', 'flame_lame': 'flames', 'blurb': \"Kelce is a swinging pendulum personified.

Despite the youngster's extraordinary peformance, Raheem Morris was displeased with Blount's execution in critical short-yardage situations. So upset was the head coach, he suggested Earnest Graham could overtake such duties. When he chooses to remove the clogs and focuses running full-steam downhill, Blount is almost impossible to stop. His combination of size and speed is devastating. Washington will soon know. Over the 'Skins' past eight games, they've conceded five 100-yard rushing games and nine TDs to RBs. Don't worry about Graham's possible expanded role. In a must-win game for Tampa, expect the rhino to spike the competition. \", 'opponent': 'Was'}, 630: {'week': '14', 'receptions': nan, 'completions': nan, 'total_yards': nan, 'receiving_yards': '5', 'player_percent_started': 0.02, 'attempts': nan, 'year': '2010', 'shocker_special': False, 'home': True, 'passing_touchdowns': nan, 'date_posted': '2010-12-08', 'interceptions': nan, 'rushing_yards': '83', 'rushing_touchdowns': nan, 'player_name': 'Ryan Torain', 'defensive_interceptions': nan, 'player_team': 'Was', 'fumbles_lost': nan, 'sacks': nan, 'away': False, 'fantasy_points': '14', 'total_touchdowns': nan, 'carries': nan, 'points_allowed': nan, 'passing_yards': nan, 'fumbles_recovered': nan, 'turnovers': nan, 'player_position': 'RB', 'flame_lame': 'flames', 'blurb': \"Prior to last week\\xe2\\x80\\x99s game against the Giants, Shanny jokingly threw down the gauntlet, hoping to push Torain.

Over that span, the Panthers have allowed 4.6 yards per carry, 174.8 total yards per game and 12 touchdowns.

Stubbornly, Munchak still refuses to fully embrace the rookie telling the Tennessean Monday Hasselbeck, despite throwing two interceptions, didn't deserve any blame for Sunday's embarrassing loss. At this point, he's still backing Hassy, but it could be early-week gamesmanship. With support for the coach shrinking faster than Tennessee's playoff hopes, Munchak needs to take a page out of John Fox's playbook and succumb to fan demands.

His yards per attempt, an outstanding 7.3 last year, has plummeted to 6.1 this year. As a result, his overall production has turned south, evident in his 18.2 points per game output, the 23rd-best mark among QBs in virtual pigskin. However, there's hope for a flashback this week against Green Bay. The Packers, one of the league's best in handcuffing QBs last year, are one of the worst this season. Signal callers are averaging a ridiculous 8.7 yards per attempt, 384.3 passing yards and two touchdowns per game against them. With or without Tramon Williams, the secondary hasn't exactly delivered flavorful results. In a contest in which the Broncos will likely fall behind early, Orton could easily eclipse 40 attempts, and accumulate plenty of garbage points, en route to a strong QB1 effort.\", 'opponent': 'GB'}, 832: {'week': '04', 'receptions': '3', 'completions': nan, 'total_yards': nan, 'receiving_yards': '18', 'player_percent_started': 0.27, 'attempts': nan, 'year': '2011', 'shocker_special': False, 'home': True, 'passing_touchdowns': nan, 'date_posted': '2011-09-27', 'interceptions': nan, 'rushing_yards': '74', 'rushing_touchdowns': nan, 'player_name': 'Arian Foster', 'defensive_interceptions': nan, 'player_team': 'Hou', 'fumbles_lost': nan, 'sacks': nan, 'away': False, 'fantasy_points': '17.4', 'total_touchdowns': nan, 'carries': nan, 'points_allowed': nan, 'passing_yards': nan, 'fumbles_recovered': nan, 'turnovers': nan, 'player_position': 'RB', 'flame_lame': 'flames', 'blurb': 'Foster\\'s maddening hamstring issue has driven the Noise to the bottle.

Because the Texans are a balanced offensive team, boast a premier O-line and are at home, Foster should thrive. Yes, Tate will supplant him on a series or two, but for the popular No. 1 pick, this is his week to finally live up to preseason expectations.

Overall, the Jags have yielded 3.0 yards per carry and the second-fewest fantasy points to RBs. But Sproles isn't your everyday up-the-gut back.

Many continue to give Tebow the stiff arm, evident in his low-start percentage. His gut-wrenching three quarters of ineffectiveness apparently is too much for most to bear. Y! colleague Michael Salfino is right. Tebow isn't the prettiest of passers. His mechanics are still greatly flawed and he's earned too much credit for wins generated not by supernatural forces, but by gifts the opposition has served on a silver platter (e.g. Marion Bartman, CHI's prevent defense). Credit to the QB, he's taken advantage. This week, however, could be all him. New England runs zone almost exclusively on defense. Injuries and a lack of talent has forced Bill Belichick into relying on the risky tactic. As a result, quarterbacks of various achievement levels have torched them. In total, 11 passers have surpassed the 20-point mark against the Pats, including the likes of Chad Henne, Jason Campbell and Dan Orlovsky. Yes, Tebow has made a number of quality NFL throws of late, especially downfield. Still, his best fantasy asset is and will remain his legs. Belichick will undoubtedly devise a game-plan to force Tebow into uncomfortable situations, but, if the Pats pile on the points early, the signal caller will no doubt find wide spaces open spaces to run wild. Based on the incredibly favorable matchup and possible catch-up element, it's conceivable the fantasy legend of No. 15 grows. In reality, a victory over the AFC Goliath may permanently erase doubts about his unrefined skills. With every improbable Tebow-led victory, an angel gets its wings.

Miami's secondary, battered by injuries and ineptitude, has surrendered 8.1 yards per attempt, 282.1 passing yards and 2.0 passing touchdowns per game this year, equal to the fourth-most fantasy points allowed. In fact, only Philip Rivers in Week 4 failed to find the end-zone multiple times against it.

Though replaced at times by Bilal Powell, he's levied the boom on early downs (64.8 YAC%), forced missed tackles on 20.6 percent of his attempts, operated as the primary goal-line option and, almost inexplicably, caught the occasional pass. Given the scorched-earth landscape at RB, he is a reliable 15-20 touch per game option in 12-team leagues, when healthy. The Dolphins defense, seemingly trapped in a fishing net, has drowned in misery, a completely unexpected outcome with Ndamukong Suh manning the trenches. They have allowed a modest 4.01 yards per carry to RBs, but, as Karlos Williams proved last week, this is a unit that can be humbled in a hurry.

The third-year man from North Carolina has secured the ball, forced more missed tackles (15), been more effective in the pass game and, shockingly, has gained more yards after contact (55.7 YAC%) compared to Hill (51.7). Last week against Baltimore, he nearly doubled his teammate's snap count, seeing action 66.2 percent of the time. Unless Hill sniffs smelling salts, that script will remain unchanged this week against Kansas City, despite Hue Jackson's claim the LSU product continues to be the starter. Evidenced in Aaron Rodgers' 5-TD undressing of KC last Monday, its weakness is clearly defending the pass. With that in mind, it's highly likely Andy Dalton and friends move the ball at will vertically, possibly setting up Gio with several goal-to-go situations.

Last year, Keenan Allen and Zac Stacy were afflicted leaving broken hearts and busted dreams in their wake. Now, it appears Hill is bearing the curse. A runaway beer truck last year, the rookie is riding on spare tires in the encore. His electric effort last fall was expected to relegate Gio Bernard to mop-up duty, but the table has turned. Hill, beleaguered by fumbles, has looked sluggish, powerless and generally rancid. Through three games, Bernard has dwarfed him in yards per carry, yards after contact and missed tackles percentage. Game flow is partially responsible for the recent snap gap, but unless Hill wakes up soon, his tag-team partner may continue to steal the headlines. KC does present a unique opportunity. Due to the Chiefs' wretched pass defense Cincy should knock at the door early and often. But it could be Bernard, who has nearly double the red-zone touches over the past two weeks, who secures the scoring spotlight. And keep in mind, for as repulsive KC has been in pass D, it's been excellent versus the run giving up just 3.54 yards per carry.

Most alarming, his 3.2 yards per carry is a far cry from the 5.2 yards per tote he logged last year. Suffice it to say, the transition from Gary Kubiak to Marc Trestmen hasn't been palatable. On the periphery, Forsett remains one of the league leaders in breakaway percentage and hasn't seen a significant drop-off in other measurements, which bodes well for a turnaround. However, the Ravens' No. 26 rank in run-blocking combined with their forgiving defense and Lorenzo Taliaferro's role at the goal-line have greatly hindered the rusher. Better days lay ahead, but don't expect a rebound in Week 4. Pittsburgh's defense, despite its youth, has collapsed on rushers quickly. It's given up only 2.87 yards per carry and the fewest fantasy points to RBs.

He hasn't evaded many tacklers (No. 32 in elusive rating) or churned out hard yards (39.7 YAC%), but he's earned considerable red-zone trust, a valuable attribute to own in fantasy. Thus far, he's logged the third-most looks (9) inside the 20 among running backs. Gordon has made strides. His improved patience, vision and explosion were on display Week 2 in Cincinnati. However, his between-the-20s role will remain unchanged this week in Minnesota, a unique opportunity for both backs. The Vikings were gashed Week 1 by Carlos Hyde but righted this ship last week against Detroit surrendering only 84 combined yards to Ameer Abdullah and Co.

Though he saw only 31 snaps, he carried the pill 19 times for 123 yards and two touchdowns. He also chipped in three receptions for 23 yards. At 6-foot-2, 230 pounds, Jones is a load. He's nimble, powerful, shifty and versatile. Overall, his game is patterned similarly to Carlos Hyde's. Though he'll work on short rest, the youngster is a viable RB2 in 12-team leagues against New York. Miniaturized on run defense, the Giants have allowed 137.5 total yards per game to opposing rushers through two games. Working behind a Washington offensive line that's executed beautifully thus far, he should flatten the competition on roughly 13-15 touches.

Though Allen Hurns is also a featured player, it's pretty clear who Blake Bortles favors. Through two weeks Robinson has 18 targets to lead the team, and with Rashad Greene now on IR, that number is sure to multiply. Another weighty workload is on the horizon. Unsurprisingly, Tom Brady has launched ground-to-air missiles to begin the season, blowing up opposing defenses. Jacksonville, which surrendered 359 pass yards, two scores and 8.2 yards per attempt to Ryan Tannehill last Sunday, is his next victim, a plausible outcome that greatly benefits Robinson. If smoke continues to rise from Brady's hand, Bortles will most certainly be thrust into a high-volume situation. More pass attempts means more targets for Robinson. Not to mention he could exploit zone offerings in garbage time.

Of course, as the season wears on, that pecking order will most certainly change, but it clearly proves the Texans' affection for the veteran receiver. Though zeroed in, Shorts hasn't done much. He's caught just 10 passes for 91 yards. With defenses focused on containing DeAndre Hopkins, favorable workloads should continue to be the norm for the ex-Jag. If he generates another eight-plus targets, this could be the week he busts out. Tampa Bay stunned the league last week by handling business inside the Superdome. Disemboweled Week 1 versus Marcus Mariota and the Titans, the Bucs plunged daggers into New Orleans holding the Saints to a very uncharacteristic 323 total yards and 4.7 average gain per play. Despite the stiff defensive effort, questions loom long-term, particularly at corner. Jonathan Banks and Alterraun Verner both rank outside the top-50 in pass coverage according to Pro Football Focus. Together the tandem have yielded two touchdowns and a 120.7 QB rating to their assignments. All told, the Bucs have given up 8.59 pass yards per attempt. Ryan Mallett was unsightly at times last week in Carolina (46.6 cmp%, 4.2 ypa), but with the butterflies out of the way, he should take a step forward.

Philly ran 70.4 offensive plays per game and averaged nearly 37 pass attempts per contest last season. In a clash where defense will be a premium, Bradford will easily cross the 40-attempt threshold. On the back-end, Atlanta has serious question marks. Corner Desmond Trufant, who ranked No. 11 in coverage and surrendered just a 74.0 QB rating to his assignments a season ago per Pro Football Focus, is an established, rigid veteran. However, his tag-team partner Robert Alford (111.6 QB RTG allowed in '14) and young safeties William Moore (109.0) and Ricardo Allen are rather giving in nature. Collectively, the 'Clean' Birds conceded 8.1 pass yards per attempt in 2014.

As a result, he performed brilliantly over the exhibition slate (5.9 ypc, 69.1 YAC%), displaying the short-field quickness and in-space wiggle indicative of his rookie season. Extremely motivated to reestablish himself as Tampa's lead back and running behind a Bucs offensive line that ranked No. 8 in run-blocking last fall, he will continue to shine. Aggressiveness is the hallmark of Dick LeBeau's 3-4 defense. Exotic run/pass blitzes will be the norm. However, Tennessee's personnel leaves a lot to be desired. Jurrell Casey is a very active edge defender and offseason acquisition, Brian Orakpo, will plug numerous gaps, but the Titans have miles to go before earning a sterling reputation.

His patience, vision and lateral agility are top-notch, qualities that typically embarrass would-be tacklers. It's tough to pinpoint exactly how much work Abdullah will receive Sunday. Theo Riddick will be peppered in some 6-8 times operating as a gadget back. Meanwhile, Joique Bell, activated off the PUP only a little over a week ago, may be worked in slowly. Fellow rookie Zach Zenner would likely fill the power back void if Joique were unavailable. Still, the Nebraska product should tote the heavy side in the timeshare, possibly surpassing 15 total touches. Against the run, San Diego was a bend, don't break, defense in 2014. Corey Liuget is a menace in the trenches, but, by in large, the Chargers' D-line is average at best. Last year, it conceded a respectable 4.05 yards per carry, but struggled mightily containing versatile RBs, as Fred Jackson, Justin Forsett and Ronnie Hillman proved.

Due to a hamstring strain, he played only sparingly in the preseason, galloping his way to eight carries on 56 yards in the final regular season tuneup. In that contest he displayed considerable explosiveness around the edge, his calling card. Overall, Coleman is a versatile, one-cut rusher with drag-racer wheels. His upright running style leaves him vulnerable to viscious hits and negative plays, but he did gain 38 of 58 yards after contact in exhibition action, a promising sign. Combine that with his plus hands and adept pass-blocking and he's a legitimate three-down back. Philly's 3-4 D, spearheaded by former Bill Kiko Alonso, is downright nasty. Last year, the Eagles allowed only 3.54 yards per carry to RBs. Against a highly suspect Atlanta offensive line, wide running lanes could be few and far between, though Matt Ryan and Julio Jones could change that.

Of course, Randle didn't catch a single one, but he did net a serviceable 4.5 receptions and 68.8 yards per game in those contests. This time around, the receiver should easily exceed those averages. Minus lock-down corner Orlando Scandrick, Dallas' secondary is hurting. Expected starters Brandon Carr and Morris Claiborne, when on the field, were repeatedly battered and bruised last year.
